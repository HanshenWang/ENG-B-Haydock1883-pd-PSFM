\imt1 THE BOOK OF TOBIAS.
\im This Book takes its name from the holy man Tobias, whose wonderful virtues are herein recorded. It contains most excellent documents of great piety, extraordinary patience, and of perfect resignation to the will of God. His humble prayer was heard, and the angel Raphael was sent to relieve him: he is thankful, and praises the Lord, calling on the children of Israel to do the same. Having lived to the age of one hundred and two years, he exhorts his son and grandsons to piety, foretells the destruction of Ninive, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem: he dies happily. (Challoner) --- The Jews themselves have a great regard for the book of Tobias; (Grotius; Sixtus Senens. VIII.) which Origen (ad Afric.) says they "read in Hebrew," meaning probably the Chaldee, (Calmet) out of which language St. Jerome translated it, preferring to displease the Pharisaical Jews, rather than not to satisfy the desires of the holy bishops Chromatius and Heliodorus. (Ep. t. III.) (Worthington) --- The Greek version seems to have been taken from another copy, or it has been executed with greater liberty by the Hellenist Jews, between the times of the Septuagint and of Theodotion. (Calmet) --- Huet and Prideaux esteem it more original; and Houbigant has translated it in his Bible, as the Council of Trent only spoke of the Latin editions then extant; and St. Jerome followed in his version the Hebrew one of a Jew, as he did not understand the Chaldee. (Haydock) --- The Syriac and the modern Hebrew edition of Fagius, agree mostly with the Greek, as that of Munster and another Hebrew copy of Huet, and the Arabic version, both unpublished, are more conformable to the Vulgate. The most ancient Latin version used before St. Jerome, was taken from the Greek; and the Fathers who lived in those ages, speak of it when they call the book of Tobias canonical. St. Augustine leaves it, however, to adopt St. Jerome's version, in his Mirrour. The copies of all these versions vary greatly, (Calmet) though the substance of the history is still the same; and in all we discover the virtues of a good parent, of a dutiful son, and virtuous husband, beautifully described. (Haydock) --- "The servant of God, holy Tobias, is given to us after the law for an example, that we might know how to practise what we read; and that if temptations assail us, we may not depart from the fear of God, nor expect help from any other." (St. Augustine, q. 119. ex utroque Test.) --- The four first chapters exhibit the holy life of old Tobias, and the eight following, the journey and affairs of his son, directed by Raphael. In the two last chapters they praise God, and the elder Tobias foretells the better state of the commonwealth. (Worthington) --- It is probable that both left records, from which this work has been compiled, with a few additional observations. It was written during (Calmet) or after the captivity of Babylon. (Estius) --- The Jews had then little communication with each other, in different kingdoms. Tobias was not allowed to go into Media, under Sennacherib; and it is probable that the captives at Babylon would be under similar restrictions; so that we do not need to wonder that they were unacquainted with this history of a private family, the records of which seem to have been kept at Ecbatana. The original Chaldee is entirely lost, so that it is impossible to ascertain whether the Greek or the Vulgate be more conformable to it. The chronology of the latter seems however more accurate, as the elder Tobias foretold the destruction of Ninive, twenty-three years before the event, which his son just beheld verified, dying in the 18th year of king Josias. The accounts which appear to sectaries to be fabulous, may easily be explained. (Houbigant) --- Josephus and Philo omit this history. (Calmet)

\cl Tobias 1
\cd Tobias's early piety: his works of mercy, particularly in burying the dead.
\p
\v 1 Tobias, of the tribe and city of Nephthali, (which is in the upper parts of Galilee, above Naason, beyond the way that leadeth to the west, having on the right hand the city of Sephet)
\p
\v 2 *When he was made captive in the days of Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians, even in his captivity, forsook not the way of truth,
\p
\v 3 But every day gave all he could get to his brethren, his fellow-captives, that were of his kindred.
\p
\v 4 And when he was younger than any of the tribe of Nephthali, yet did he no childish thing in his work.
\p
\v 5 Moreover, when all went to the golden calves, *which Jeroboam, king of Israel, had made, he alone fled the company of all,
\p
\v 6 And went to Jerusalem, to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his first-fruits, and his tithes.
\p
\v 7 So that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes, and strangers.
\p
\v 8 These, and such like things did he observed when but a boy, according to the law of God.
\p
\v 9 But when he was a man, he took to wife, Anna, of his own tribe, and had a son by her, whom he called after his own name,
\p
\v 10 And from his infancy he taught him to fear God, and to abstain from all sin.
\p
\v 11 And when, by the captivity, he, with his wife, and his son, and all his tribe, was come to the city of Ninive,
\p
\v 12 (When all ate of the meats of the Gentiles) he kept his soul, and never was defiled with their meats.
\p
\v 13 And because he was mindful of the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar, the king.
\p
\v 14 And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.
\p
\v 15 He, therefore, went to all that were in captivity, and gave them wholesome admonitions.
\p
\v 16 And when he was come to Rages, a city of the Medes, and had ten talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king:
\p
\v 17 And when amongst a great multitude of his kindred, he saw Gabelus in want, who was one of his tribe, taking a note of his hand, he gave him the aforesaid sum of money.
\p
\v 18 But after a long time, Salmanasar, the king, being dead, *when Sennacherib, his son, who reigned in his place, had a hatred for the children of Israel:
\p
\v 19 Tobias daily went among all his kindren, and comforted them, and distributed to every one as he was able, out of his goods:
\p
\v 20 He fed the hungry, and gave clothes to the naked, and was careful to bury the dead, and they that were slain.
\p
\v 21 *And when **king Sennacherib was come back, fleeing from Judea, by reason of the slaughter that God had made about him for his blasphemy, and being angry, slew many of the children of Israel, Tobias buried their bodies.
\p
\v 22 But when it was told the king, he commanded him to be slain, and took away all his substance.
\p
\v 23 But Tobias fleeing naked away with his son, and with his wife, lay concealed; for many loved him.
\p
\v 24 *But after forty-five days, the king was killed by his own sons.
\p
\v 25 And Tobias returned to his house, and all his substance was restored to him.

\f + \fr 1:1\ft Tobias, "good God," (Tirinus) is styled Tobis, by the ancient Latin version and St. Ambrose, and Tobit by the Greek and Syriac. These copies and the Hebrew give a genealogy which does not agree. (Calmet) --- Grabe's edition, "The book of the words (or transactions) of Tobit, Son of Tobiel, son of Ananiel, son of Adouel, (manuscript has Nave) son of Galael, (manuscript, Gamael) of the seed of Asiel, of the tribe of Nephthali, (2) who was made captive in the days of Enemessar, king of the Assyrians, from Thisbe, (manuscript, Thibe) which is on the right properly (manuscript, of Kudis; Haydock) or Cades, capital (Calmet) of Nephthali in Galilee, above Aser. I, Tobit, walked in the ways of truth and of justice all the days of my life." (Haydock) --- Nehemias and the prophets frequently speak of themselves in the first person. The truth of the history is the same. (Du Hamel) --- Beyond, or behind; (post; Haydock) as the Hebrews speak with reference to a man turned towards the east. Hence this way would be on the west, and Sephet on the north.\f*
\f + \fr 1:2\ft Salmanasar. When Osee was conquered, in the year of the world 3283. See 4 Kings 17:6. --- Truth. His constancy in the observance of the true religion was so much the more wonderful, as he was rich, and lived among the wicked. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:3\ft Kindred. Greek adds, "who went along with me....to Ninive."\f*
\f + \fr 1:4\ft Younger. "Very young," (Haydock) or the youngest of those who administered their own affairs. The parents of Tobias were deceased. (Calmet) --- Greek, "when I was young in my country, in the land of Israel, all the tribe," etc.\f*
\f + \fr 1:5\ft All, or the greatest part; (Haydock) for some still feared God; (chap. 2:2.; Worthington) and the Greek of Tobias 5:14 or 19 informs us that Ananias and Jonathan accompanied Tobias. (Haydock) --- Greek is more diffuse. (Calmet) --- (4) "All the tribe of Nephthali, of my father, departed from the house of Jerusalem, which city had been chosen from all the tribes of Israel, for all the tribes to offer sacrifice; and the temple of the tabernacle of the most High was sanctified, and was built for ever; (5) and all the tribes, apostatizing together, sacrificed to Baal, to the heifer; (Comp. ed., to the power of Baal) and the house of Nephthali, of my father, likewise. (6) And I alone went frequently to Jerusalem, at the feasts" (Haydock) of the Passover, ete. (Menochius) --- The other versions are nearly similar. (Calmet) --- But we cannot specify all these variations. (Haydock) --- The number has induced some to conclude, not improbably, that there were two originals; (Tirinus) the Syriac by the elder, and the Chaldee by the younger Tobias. (Justiniani.) --- But this is destitute of proof. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:7\ft Strangers. See Deuteronomy 14:28., (Menochius) Leviticus 27:30. (Calmet) --- Greek, "And the third I gave to whom it belonged, as Debbora, my father's mother, ordered me, as I was left an orphan by my father; (9) and when I was," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:9\ft Man. The Jews married young: but the time was not fixed. (Calmet) --- After. Greek, "Tobias." They always style the father Tobit. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:11\ft Ninive, called Ninus by Pliny, etc. (Menochius) --- It was so large, as easily to receive a whole tribe, which was sold for slaves. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:12\ft Meats, such as had been immolated to idols, (Menochius) or were forbidden to the Jews. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:14\ft And he. Greek, "I was his marketter," (Haydock) to provide provisions for the palace. "He set me over all he had, till the day of his death." (Munster.) --- But this Hebrew author has probably exaggerated the matter, to make Tobias appear as great as he could. These editions add no more, continuing, (15) "And I went into Media, and I deposited with Gabael, or Gabelus," etc.\f*
\f + \fr 1:16\ft Rages means "rupture," by frequent earthquakes, and was (Menochius; Calmet) the residence of the Parthian kings, in spring, (Athen. 12:2.) in the mountain, separating their country from Media. --- Honoured for his salary. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:17\ft Money. People might formerly make use of what was merely deposited in their hands. (Ulpian.) --- The old Latin version has, "I committed to him ten talents in gold."\f*
\f + \fr 1:18\ft Time. Salmanasar reigned fourteen years; seven after the captivity, which to people in distress would appear long. (Calmet) --- Greek, "And after Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib, his son, reigned in his stead; and his ways ceased, (or his high roads were stopped) and I could no longer go into Media." (Haydock) --- We find nothing in history to confirm this stoppage: (Calmet) but it might be in consequence of the wars. (Houbigant) See the preface. (Haydock) --- Israel. This hatred was augmented, after the unfortunate expedition into Palestine. (Calmet) (Menochius) (4 Kings 19:35.)\f*
\f + \fr 1:19\ft Goods, under Sennacherib; though he was now deprived of his place. (Calmet) --- Greek, Syriac, and Hebrew insinuate, that this happened under his predecessor. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:20\ft Slain, by order or connivance of Sennacherib. (Menochius) --- Tobias buried the dead, out of charity, and the belief of a future resurrection. Hence arises the respect for tombs and the relics of the saints. (Calmet) --- The pagans imagined that the souls could not rest till their bodies were interred. (Homer, Virgil vii., etc.) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:23\ft Loved him, even of the Assyrians. The Jews were not able to afford him shelter. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 1:24\ft Forty. Arabic, twenty-five; Greek and Syriac, fifty; other Greek copies, fifty-five days. Fagius says Tobias was hidden nineteen days. It seems, therefore, we should date these forty-five days from the return of Sennacherib. --- Sons. See 4 Kings 19:37., and Isaias 37:38. (Calmet) --- Greek adds, "and they fled to the mountains of Ararat, and Sacherdoc, (our Assaraddon) his son, reigned in his stead; and he appointed Achiachar Anael, the son of my brother, over all the accounts of his kingdom, and over all his government. And Achiachar petitioned for me; and I came to Ninive. But Achiachar was cup-bearer, (Alexandrian manuscript, receiver of wine) and keeper of the ring, and governor and keeper of accounts; and Sacherdonosos gave him the second place. But he was my nephew. And when I returned to my house, and my wife Anna, and my son Tobias, were restored to me, at the feast of Pentecost," etc. (Haydock) --- This seems contrary to ver. 23. Yet the Hebrew copies agree in this particular, and mention the dignity of Akikar. But we may judge what credit these additions deserve. (Calmet) --- They merit some attention, as they may be original. See Preface. (Haydock)\f*

\cl Tobias 2
\cd Tobias leaveth his dinner to bury the dead: he loseth his sight by God's permission, for manifestation of his patience.
\p
\v 1 But after this, when there was a festival of the Lord, and a good dinner was prepared in Tobias's house,
\p
\v 2 He said to his son: Go, and bring some of our tribe, that fear God, to feast with us.
\p
\v 3 And when he had gone, returning, he told him, that one of the children of Israel lay slain in the street. And he forthwith leaped up from his place at the table, and left his dinner, and came fasting to the body:
\p
\v 4 And taking it up, carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.
\p
\v 5 And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,
\p
\v 6 Remembering the word which the Lord spoke by *Amos, the prophet: Your festival days shall be turned into lamentation and mourning.
\p
\v 7 So when the sun was down, he went and buried him.
\p
\v 8 Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: Once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?
\p
\v 9 *But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.
\p
\v 10 Now it happened one day, that being wearied with burying, he came to his house, and cast himself down by the wall, and slept.
\p
\v 11 And as he was sleeping, hot dung, out of a swallow's nest, fell upon his eyes, and he was made blind.*
\p
\v 12 Now this trial the Lord, therefore, permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.
\p
\v 13 For, whereas, he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments; he repined not against God, because the evil of blindness had befallen him,
\p
\v 14 But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.
\p
\v 15 For as the kings insulted over holy Job, so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:
\p
\v 16 Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?
\p
\v 17 But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:
\p
\v 18 For we are the children of saints, and look for that life which God will give to those that never change their faith from him.
\p
\v 19 Now Anna, his wife, went daily to weaving work, and she brought home what she could get for their living by the labour of her hands.
\p
\v 20 Whereby it came to pass, that she received a young kid, and brought it home:
\p
\v 21 And when her husband heard it bleating, he said: *Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen, restore ye it to its owners; for it is not lawful for us either to eat or to touch any thing that cometh by theft.
\p
\v 22 *At these words, his wife being angry, answered: It is evident thy hope is come to nothing, and thy alms now appear.
\p
\v 23 And with these, and other such like words, she upbraided him.

\f + \fr 2:1\ft House. The law authorized such feasts, Deuteronomy 12:12, and 14:28. Tobias complied with it, by inviting also the poor servants of God. Greek, "I lay down to eat." This custom prevailed in the East. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:2\ft Tribe. Greek, "brethren indigent, and who remembers God." (Haydock) --- All had not given way to idolatry. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:3\ft Street. Asarhaddon did not protect the Israelites, which renders the elevation of Akikar to the highest dignities suspicious. (Calmet) --- But the king and his minister might not be able to prevent all murders. (Haydock) --- Fasting. The ancients seldom eat anything before noon. Greek, "Before I had tasted, I leaped up and took him to a house, till the sun should be set," (Haydock) to prevent any danger from the Assyrians. (Menochius) --- lf he did not employ another, he must have eaten alone, being rendered unclean. This seems to have been the case; and hence he did not enter his own house, but lay down by the wall. (Calmet) --- Greek and Hebrew mention, that he washed himself before he eat. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:9\ft But. This version is not in Greek or Hebrew. (Calmet) --- True zeal is not repressed by fear, as charity expels it, 1 John 4:(Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:10\ft Now. Greek, "And that very night I was." --- He came. Greek, "I lay myself down, being defiled, beside the wall of the court, and my face was uncovered." (Haydock) --- The touching the dead rendered a person unclean, Numbers 19:11.\f*
\f + \fr 2:11\ft Swallow's. Greek denotes "sparrows," or any other small birds: strouthia. (Serarius) --- Eyes. Greek observes that they were "opened." Hebrew, "by chance." Yet "hares, and many men, sleep with their eyes open," (Pliny XI 37.) as was here the case. (St. Athanasius, Synops.) --- lf not, the dung might insinuate itself by rubbing. It is extremely caustic. (Vales. 42.; Aldrov.17.; etc.) --- The blindness of Tobias was only a suspension of sight. (Calmet) --- Blind. Greek, "white specks or skins came upon my eyes, and I went to the physicians, but they afforded me no relief. But Achiachar fed me (Haydock) till I (or he) went to Elymais;" Hebrew of Fagius, "into Germany." (Calmet) --- Almniim. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:12\ft Now. This is omitted in Greek and Hebrew as far as ver. 19. St. Ambrose says beautifully, that Tobias "was more grieved that he could yield no assistance to others, than for the loss of his sight."\f*
\f + \fr 2:15\ft Kings. So Job's three friends are here called, because they were princes in their respective territories, (Challoner) like the petty kings of Palestine, in the days of Abraham and of Josue. They are styled kings in the Greek version of Job. (Calmet) --- Relations, (parentes.) His father and mother were dead. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:18\ft Saints; Abraham, etc. Thus Mathathias encouraged his children; (1 Machabees 2:50.) and no argument can be more forcible. Dice puer virtutem ex me, verumque laborem Sis memor, et te animo repetentem exempla tuorum Et pater Aeneas et avunculus excitet Hector. -----Virgil, Aeneid xii. --- Life eternal. These grand truths were more developed, as the Messias was nearer at hand.\f*
\f + \fr 2:19\ft Work. This was usually the employment of women. The great charities of Tobias, physicians, etc., had reduced him to poverty.\f*
\f + \fr 2:20\ft Kid, which had not left off sucking. Greek adds, that this was given besides the usual wages. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 2:21\ft Theft. He was the master of the family, and knew that there was no money in the house, so that he was not guilty of rash judgment, (Menochius) though his wife might naturally be offended.\f*
\f + \fr 2:22\ft At. Greek, "but she said: It was given to me in addition to my wages. Yet I did not give credit to her, and I ordered her to restore it to its owners; and I blushed for her. But she replied: Where are thy alms-deeds and thy just works? Behold, all things are known with thee. Then, through grief, I wept," etc. (Haydock) --- Hope in God, who nevertheless leaves us in distress. (Menochius) --- She indirectly finds fault with Providence, which increases the grief of Tobias; or, at least, she insinuates that he must have been a hypocrite, as the friends of Job unjustly argued, from his being afflicted. (Haydock)\f*

\cl Tobias 3
\cd The prayer of Tobias, and of Sara, in their several afflictions, are heard by God, and the angel Raphael is sent to relieve them.
\p
\v 1 Then Tobias sighed, and began to pray with tears,
\p
\v 2 Saying: Thou art just, O Lord, and all thy judgments are just, and all thy ways are mercy, and truth, and judgment:
\p
\v 3 And now, O Lord, think of me, and take not revenge of my sins, neither remember my offences, nor those of my parents.
\p
\v 4 *For we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore are we delivered to spoil and to captivity, and death, and are made a fable, and a reproach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us.
\p
\v 5 And now, O Lord, great are thy judgments, because we have not done according to thy precepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee:
\p
\v 6 And now, O Lord, do with me according to thy will, and command my spirit to be received in peace: for it is better for me to die, than to live.
\p
\v 7 Now it happened on the same day, that Sara, daughter of Raguel, in Rages, a city of the Medes, received a reproach from one of her father's servant-maids,
\p
\v 8 Because she had been given to seven husbands, and a devil named Asmodeus had killed them, at their first going in unto her.
\p
\v 9 So when she reproved the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying: May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou murderer of thy husbands.
\p
\v 10 Wilt thou kill me also, as thou hast already killed seven husbands? At these words she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for three days and three nights did neither eat, nor drink:
\p
\v 11 But continuing in prayer, with tears besought God, that he would deliver her from this reproach.
\p
\v 12 And it came to pass on the third day, when she was making an end of her prayer, blessing the Lord,
\p
\v 13 She said: Blessed is thy name, O God of our fathers: who when thou hast been angry, wilt shew mercy, and in the time of tribulation forgivest the sins of them that call upon thee.
\p
\v 14 To thee, O Lord, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.
\p
\v 15 I beg, O Lord, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach, or else take me away from the earth.
\p
\v 16 Thou knowest, O Lord, that I never coveted a husband, and have kept my soul clean from all lust.
\p
\v 17 Never have I joined myself with them that play: neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.
\p
\v 18 But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my lust.
\p
\v 19 And either I was unworthy of them, or they, perhaps, were not worthy of me: because, perhaps, thou hast kept me for another man.
\p
\v 20 For thy counsel is not in man's power.
\p
\v 21 But this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be under trial, shall be crowned: and if it be under tribulation, it shall be delivered: and if it be under correction, it shall be allowed to come to thy mercy.
\p
\v 22 For thou art not delighted in our being lost: because, after a storm thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in joyfulness.
\p
\v 23 Be thy name, O God of Israel, blessed for ever.
\p
\v 24 At that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of the glory of the most high God:
\p
\v 25 And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael, was sent to heal them both, whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the Lord.
\x + \xo 3:4\xt Deuteronomy 28:15.\x*
\f + \fr 3:1\ft Then, retiring, ver. 25. --- Tears. He manifests no degree of impatience. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 3:2\ft Judgment. Even in punishing, God remembers mercy, (Haydock) and never fails to perform what he has promised.\f*
\f + \fr 3:3\ft Parents, so as to punish me on their account. (Menochius) --- The Scripture frequently seems to indicate that this is the case; (Exodus 20:5.) and the Church still prays, Remember not, O Lord, our offences, nor those of our parents. (Calmet) --- But children are only punished when they imitate the wicked conduct of their ancestors: they may be afflicted, though innocent, as their virtue will thus be tried, and shine more gloriously. (Haydock) --- The pagans, being convinced that God can be guilty of no injustice, and perceiving that people who appeared to be free from sin were yet unhappy, concluded that they were explaining the sins committed in another world. (Plotin. 2:13.; Origen, prin. iii.) (Calmet) --- This might arise from a confused notion of original sin. (Pascal's Thoughts.) (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 3:6\ft Peace. Greek, "that I may be dissolved, and return to the earth; (literally, become earth) because it is more advantageous for me to die than to live, since I have heard false reproaches, and am much grieved. Command that I may be freed from this necessity, to go to my eternal place." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 3:7\ft Rages. In the Greek it is Ecbatana which was also called Rages. For there were two cities in Media of the name of Rages: Raguel dwelt in one of them and Gabelus in the other.

\cd Tobias thinking he shall die, giveth his son godly admonitions: and telleth him of money he had lent to a friend.
\p
\v 1 Therefore, *when Tobias thought that his prayer was heard that he might die, he called to him Tobias, his son,
\p
\v 2 And said to him: Hear, my son, the words of my mouth, and lay them as a fountain in thy heart.
\p
\v 3 When God shall take my soul, thou shalt bury my body: *and thou shalt honour thy mother all the days of her life:
\p
\v 4 For thou must be mindful what and how great perils she suffered for thee in her womb.
\p
\v 5 And when she also shall have ended the time of her life, bury her by me.
\p
\v 6 And all the days of thy life have God in thy mind: and take heed thou never consent to sin, nor transgress the commandments of the Lord, our God.
\p
\v 7 *Give alms out of thy substance, and turn not away thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass, that the face of the Lord shall not be turned from thee.
\p
\v 8 *According to thy ability be merciful.
\p
\v 9 If thou have much, give abundantly: if thou have little, take care even so to bestow willingly a little.
\p
\v 10 For thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward for the day of necessity.
\p
\v 11 *For alms deliver from all sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness.
\p
\v 12 Alms shall be a great confidence before the most high God, to all them that give it.
\p
\v 13 *Take heed to keep thyself, my son, from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know a crime.
\p
\v 14 Never suffer pride to reign in thy mind, or in thy words: *for from it all perdition took its beginning.
\p
\v 15 *If any man hath done any work for thee, immediately pay him his hire, and let not the wages of thy hired servant stay with thee at all.
\p
\v 16 *See thou never do to another what thou wouldst hate to have done to thee by another.
\p
\v 17 *Eat thy bread with the hungry and the needy, and with thy garments cover the naked.
\p
\v 18 Lay out thy bread, and thy wine, upon the burial of a just man, and do not eat and drink thereof with the wicked.
\p
\v 19 Seek counsel always of a wise man.
\p
\v 20 Bless God at all times: and desire of him to direct thy ways, and that all thy counsels may abide in him.
\p
\v 21 I tell thee also, my son, that I lent ten talents of silver, while thou wast yet a child, to Gabelus, in Rages, a city of the Medes, and I have a note of his hand with me:
\p
\v 22 Now, therefore, inquire how thou mayst go to him, and receive of him the aforesaid sum of money, and restore to him the note of his hand.
\p
\v 23 Fear not, my son: we lead indeed a poor life, *but we shall have many good things if we fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is good.

\cd Young Tobias seeking a guide for his journey, the angel Raphael, in shape of a man, undertaketh this office.
\p
\v 1 Then Tobias answered his father, and said: I will do all things, father, which thou hast commanded me.
\p
\v 2 But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell: he knoweth not me, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? nor did I ever know the way which leadeth thither.
\p
\v 3 Then his father answered him, and said: I have a note of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.
\p
\v 4 But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, to go with thee for his hire: that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.
\p
\v 5 Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk.
\p
\v 6 And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and said: From whence art thou, good young man?
\p
\v 7 But he answered: Of the children of Israel. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?
\p
\v 8 And he answered: I know it: and I have often walked through all the ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus, our brother, who dwelleth at Rages, a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of Ecbatana.
\p
\v 9 And Tobias said to him: Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father.
\p
\v 10 Then Tobias going in, told all these things to his father. Upon which his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in unto him.
\p
\v 11 So going in, he saluted him, and said: Joy be to thee always.
\p
\v 12 And Tobias said: What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven?
\p
\v 13 And the young man said to him: Be of good courage, thy cure from God is at hand.
\p
\v 14 And Tobias said to him: Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus, at Rages, a city of the Medes? and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire.
\p
\v 15 And the angel said to him: I will conduct him thither, and bring him back to thee.
\p
\v 16 And Tobias said to him: I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or what tribe art thou?
\p
\v 17 And Raphael, the angel, answered: Dost thou seek the family of him thou hirest, or the hired servant himself, to go with thy son?
\p
\v 18 But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias, the son of the great Ananias.
\p
\v 19 And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great family. But I pray thee be not angry that I desired to know thy family.
\p
\v 20 And the angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe.
\p
\v 21 And Tobias answering, said: May you have a good journey, and God be with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.
\p
\v 22 Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their journey, Tobias bid his father and his mother farewell, and they set out both together.
\p
\v 23 *And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us.
\p
\v 24 I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.
\p
\v 25 For our poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it as riches, that we saw our son.
\p
\v 26 And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son will arrive thither safe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.
\p
\v 27 For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and doth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy.

\f + \fr 5:18\ft But lest. Greek Comp., "and Tobit said, brother, I wish to know thy race and thy name. But he replied, I am of the race of Azarias, and of Ananias, who is also thy brother." Whitaker would have this to be a lie. (Haydock) --- But the apparitions of angels are not to be examined by the ordinary rules of life. They take the name of God without scruple, as they acted in his name, Genesis 31:11. (Calmet; Menochius; Tirinus) --- Azarias. The angel took the form of Azarias; and therefore might call himself by the name of the man whom he personated. Azarias, in Hebrew, signifies the help of God; and Ananias, the grace of God. (Challoner) --- Tobias had not inquired whether he was a man or an angel, as Houbigant answers the objection of Prideaux. (Haydock) --- The "help and medicine of God" nearly correspond.

Thou art of a great stock, brother. But tell me what reward I shall give thee? A drachm a day, and what may be requisite for thee and for my son.

\cl Tobias 6
\cd By the angel's advice, young Tobias taketh hold on a fish that assaulteth him. Reserveth the heart, the gall, and the liver, for medicines. They lodge at the house of Raguel, whose daughter, Sara, Tobias is to marry; she had before been married to seven husbands, who were all slain by a devil.
\p
\v 1 And *Tobias went forward, and the dog followed him, and he lodged the first night by the river of Tigris.
\p
\v 2 And he went out to wash his feet, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him.
\p
\v 3 And Tobias being afraid of him, cried out with a loud voice, saying: Sir, he cometh upon me.
\p
\v 4 And the angel said to him: Take him by the gill, and draw him to thee. And when he had done so, he drew him out upon the land, and he began to pant before his feet.
\p
\v 5 Then the angel said to him: Take out the entrails of this fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver, for thee: for these are necessary for useful medicines.
\p
\v 6 And when he had done so, he roasted the flesh thereof, and they took it with them in the way: the rest they salted, as much as might serve them, till they came to Rages, the city of the Medes.
\p
\v 7 Then Tobias asked the angel, and said to him: I beseech thee, brother Azarias, tell me what remedies are these things good for, which thou hast bid me keep of the fish?
\p
\v 8 And the angel, answering, said to him: If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of devils, either from man or from woman, so that they come no more to them.
\p
\v 9 And the gall is good for anointing the eyes, in which there is a white speck, and they shall be cured.
\p
\v 10 And Tobias said to him: Where wilt thou that we lodge?
\p
\v 11 And the angel answering, said: Here is one whose name is Raguel, a near kinsman of thy tribe, and he hath a daughter named Sara, but he hath no son nor any other daughter beside her.
\p
\v 12 *All his substance is due to thee, and thou must take her to wife.
\p
\v 13 Ask her, therefore, of her father, and he will give her thee to wife.
\p
\v 14 Then Tobias answered, and said: I hear that she hath been given to seven husbands, and they all died: moreover, I have heard, that a devil killed them.
\p
\v 15 Now I am afraid, lest the same thing should happen to me also: and whereas I am the only child of my parents, I should bring down their old age with sorrow to hell.
\p
\v 16 Then the angel, Raphael, said to him: Hear me, and I will shew thee who they are, over whom the devil can prevail.
\p
\v 17 For they who in such manner receive matrimony, as to shut out God from themselves, and from their mind, and to give themselves to their lust, as the horse and mule, which have not understanding, over them the devil hath power.
\p
\v 18 But thou, when thou shalt take her, go into the chamber, and for three days keep thyself continent from her, and give thyself to nothing else but to prayers with her.
\p
\v 19 And on that night lay the liver of the fish on the fire, and the devil shall be driven away.
\p
\v 20 But the second night thou shalt be admitted into the society of the holy patriarchs.
\p
\v 21 And the third night thou shalt obtain a blessing, that sound children may be born of you.
\p
\v 22 And when the third night is past, thou shalt take the virgin, with the fear of the Lord, moved rather for love of children than for lust, that in the seed of Abraham thou mayst obtain a blessing in children.

Those who attack the authority of this book, infer that such a trifle would not be noticed by the Holy Spirit, Tobias 11:9. Yet Homer mentions the fawning of the dog upon Ulysses, after he had been 20 years from home; and the gravest historians record instances of the fidelity of dogs. (Calmet) --- Night, or stage, mansione, (Haydock) at a caravansera, or house where travellers might stop all night, and sometimes, though seldom, might be supplied with necessaries.

\f + \fr 6:2\ft Feet. Greek, "to bathe." --- Fish. The learned are of opinion that this was the fish which Pliny calls callyonymus, ([Natural History?] L. XXII. ch. 7.) the gall of which is of sovereign virtue to remove white specks that grow over the eyes. (Challoner) --- Other fishes have the like virtue; and as the aforesaid has no scales, and is not above a foot long, it could not be lawfully eaten by the Israelites, nor could it suffice for ten days' provision, ver. 6. (Leviticus 11:10.) Others, therefore, prefer (Calmet) the sea-calf, (Brado) the hippopotamus, (Grotius) the crocodile, (Denis the Carthusian) whale, (Theophylactus) sturgeon, or silurus. (Bochart, Anim. 4:15.) --- But there are great difficulties with respect to all these; and Fran. George adopts the sentiment of the Rabbins in favour of the pike, which seems the least objectionable, as it has scales, gills, and cannot live long out of water, ver. 4. It grows to a great size in the Tigris, and its gall is good for the eyes. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 6:3\ft And. This verse is not in Greek. Tobias and the fish were both in the water. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 6:4\ft Take him. "It," would be as proper. --- Gill. Greek, "Seize the fish, and the boy got the better of the fish, and threw it upon the land."

God was pleased to give to these things a virtue against those proud spirits, to make them, who affected to be like the Most High, subject to such mean corporeal creatures, as instruments of his power. (Challoner) --- God sometimes makes use of things as remedies which have, naturally, a different effect; as when Christ put clay on the eyes of the blind man, John ix. The things which the angel ordered were salutary, by God's appointment. (Worthington) --- They could not act directly upon a spirit: but they might upon the person troubled by one, as Saul was relieved by music. (Calmet, Diss.) --- The smoke was a sign of the devil's expulsion, and of the efficacy of prayer; or rather, God subjected the proud spirits to such weak elements. (Serarius, q. 3.)

\f + \fr 6:9\ft Gall. This is generally allowed by physicians to be most excellent, particularly that of the callyonymus, and of the hyena, (Vales, Phil. 42.; Galen 10.; Menochius) and silurus, etc., so that one objection of the adversaries of this book falls to the ground. (Houbigant)\f*

The girl is beautiful and prudent. Now, therefore, give ear to me, and I will speak to her father, and when we return from Rages, we will celebrate the nuptials. For I know Raguel, that he will not give her to another man, comformably to the law of Moses, or he will incur death; because thou art entitled to the inheritance before any other.

Now, therefore, I fear lest I should die, and bring down the life of my father and mother upon me to their grave." (Haydock) --- If this text may be styled Scripture, it only records the opinion of Toby[Tobias]. (Calmet) or what he had "heard." (Haydock) --- Many grave authors have been of the same persuasion that devils could be enamoured with mortal beauties: (Calmet) talesque asseverant ut hoc negare impudentiae esse videatur. (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] 15:23; Delrio, Magic. 2.) --- But this opinion is now almost entirely abandoned. Many who have testified such things, may have experienced only some diabolical illusions. The devil could not love the beauty, nor the virtue of Sara. But he was permitted by God to exercise his malice against those who would have gratified their impure desires. (Calmet) --- We may perhaps decide too peremptorily on the nature of devils, with which we are little acquainted. As they are susceptible of pride, anger, etc., why may they not also give way to some subtle kind of mental impurity? (Houbigant)\f*

\f + \fr 6:16\ft Raphael. Greek, "said to him: Dost thou not remember that thy father ordered thee to take a wife of thy kindered? Now then hearken to me, brother; for she shall be thy wife. Mind not the devil.

Yet he is not always permitted to kill them, as God often allows them time for repentance, or suffers them to draw down heavier judgments. (Menochius) --- "The devils can do no more than God secretly permits;" (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] 2:23.) and "God justly suffers the wicked to fall victims to their iniquitous appetites." (St. Gregory, mor. ii.)\f*
\f + \fr 6:18\ft Days. No morality could be more pure. The Christian Church has given similar counsels, in the Capitulars of France, and of Erard, archbishop of Tours, and in many rituals published in the 16th century. The council of Trent only advises people to approach to the sacraments of penance and the Holy Eucharist, three days at least before marriage. The Greeks, in their third council of Carthage, (canon 13) order the first night to be spent in continence.\f*
\f + \fr 6:19\ft Lay. Greek adds, "some of the heart....and make it smoke, and the devil shall smell, and flee away, and shall not return for ever." (Haydock) --- This is contrary to reason, say our adversaries. But though devils be incorporeal, may they not be affected by certain bodies, as our souls are when our limbs are hurt? The angel chose this sort of usual exorcism, that those who were present might be convinced of the devilâ€™s departure. As the devils abuse the works of the creation, it was convenient that they should be punished by them; as they submit to magical operations, they must feel the power of such exorcisms (Houbigant) as are authorized by God and his Church.

Fear not, for she was prepared for thee from eternity; and thou shalt save her, and she shall go with thee; and I flatter myself that thou shalt have children of her. And as soon as Tobias heard this, he loved her, and his soul was much attached to her: and they arrived at Ecbatana." (Haydock) --- Some may wonder that Tobias did not ask for the consent of his parents. But the angel reminded him of his fatherâ€™s injunctions, (Calmet) and spoke in such a manner, that he was convinced his counsel was from God. (Haydock)\f*

\v 6 And when he was speaking many good things of him, the angel said to Raguel: Tobias, concerning whom thou inquirest, is this young man's father.
\p
\v 7 And Raguel went to him, and kissed him with tears, and weeping upon his neck, said: A blessing be upon thee, my son, because thou art the son of a good and most virtuous man.
\p
\v 8 And Anna, his wife, and Sara, their daughter, wept.
\p
\v 9 And after they had spoken, Raguel commanded a sheep to be killed, and a feast to be prepared. And when he desired them to sit down to dinner,

\v 10 Tobias said: I will not eat nor drink here this day, unless thou first grant me my petition, and promise to give me Sara, thy daughter.
\p
\v 11 Now when Raguel heard this, he was afraid, knowing what had happened to those seven husbands that went in unto her: and he began to fear, lest it might happen to him also in like manner: and as he was in suspense, and gave no answer to his petition,
\p
\v 12 The angel said to him: Be not afraid to give her to this man, for to him who feareth God, is thy daughter due to be his wife: therefore another could not have her.
\p
\v 13 Then Raguel said: I doubt not but God hath regarded my prayers and tears in his sight.
\p
\v 14 And I believe he hath therefore made you come to me, that this maid might be married to one of her own kindred, *according to the law of Moses: and now doubt not but I will give her to thee.
\p
\v 15 And taking the right hand of his daughter, he gave it into the right hand of Tobias, saying: The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, be with you, and may he join you together, and fulfil his blessing in you.

I gave my child to seven husbands, and when they entered in to her, they died the very night. For the present, therefore, be merry. And Tobias said: I will taste nothing here, till you produce and place her before me. And Raguel said: Take care of her henceforth, according to judgment: (Haydock; or the law.; Calmet) you are brother and sister. May then the merciful God grant you the greatest prosperity. And he called Sara, his daughter, and she came to her father: then taking her by the hand, he gave her," ver. 15.

\cd Tobias burneth part of the fish's liver, and Raphael bindeth the devil. Tobias and Sara pray.
\p
\v 1 And *after they had supped, they brought in the young man to her.
\p
\v 2 And Tobias, remembering the angel's word, took out of his bag part of the liver, and laid it upon burning coals.
\p
\v 3 Then the angel, Raphael, took the devil, and bound him in the desert of Upper Egypt.
\p
\v 4 Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, and said to her: Sara, arise, and let us pray to God to-day, and to-morrow, and the next day: because for these three nights we are joined to God: and when the third night is over, we will be in our own wedlock.
\p
\v 5 For we are the children of saints, and we must not be joined together like heathens that know not God.
\p
\v 6 So they both arose, and prayed earnestly both together that health might be given them.
\p
\v 7 And Tobias said: Lord God of our father, may the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, bless thee.
\p
\v 8 *Thou madest Adam of the slime of the earth, and gavest him Eve for a helper.
\p
\v 9 And now, Lord, thou knowest, that not for fleshly lust do I take my sister to wife, but only for the love of posterity, in which thy name may be blessed for ever and ever.
\p
\v 10 Sara also said: Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and let us grow old both together in health.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass about the cock crowing, Raguel ordered his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave.
\p
\v 12 For he said: Lest, perhaps it may have happened to him, in like manner as it did to the other seven husbands that went in unto her.
\p
\v 13 And when they had prepared the pit, Raguel went back to his wife, and said to her:
\p
\v 14 Send one of thy maids, and let her see if he be dead, that I may bury him before it be day.
\p
\v 15 So she sent one of her maid-servants, who went into the chamber, and found them safe and sound, sleeping both together.
\p
\v 16 And returning, she brought the good news: and Raguel, and Anna, his wife, blessed the Lord,
\p
\v 17 And said: We bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because it hath not happened as we suspected.
\p
\v 18 For thou hast shewn thy mercy to us, and hast shut out from us the enemy that persecuted us.
\p
\v 19 And thou hast taken pity upon two only children. Make them, O Lord, bless thee more fully: and to offer up to thee a sacrifice of thy praise, and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou alone art God in all the earth.
\p
\v 20 And immediately Raguel commanded his servants to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.
\p
\v 21 And he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast, and prepare all kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey.
\p
\v 22 He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and a banquet to be prepared for all his neighbours, and all his friends.
\p
\v 23 And Raguel adjured Tobias, to abide with him two weeks.

(Worthington) --- Greek, "and he took the ashes of incense, and placed thereon the heart of the fish and the liver, causing them to smoke. And when the devil perceived the odour, he fled to the highest parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him," (Haydock) confining his malice to those deserts. Jesus Christ insinuates that the devil walks through dry places, Matthew 12:24. The angel was not seen to absent himself: (Calmet) --- This country was chosen as being very remote from Media. (Houbigant) --- It was afterwards sanctified by the presence of many Christian solitaries. (Haydock) --- Our adversaries laugh at this account.

\p
\v 5 We, having all things together in thee alone, ought not to have let thee go from us.

(Haydock) --- The Jews still adopt many customs similar to those which we here behold, as this is a most excellent description of a holy marriage. (Serarius) (Calmet) --- Some also prevail in the Christian Church, though marriage is now become more holy, and a sacrament. (Cat. Rom. q. 22.) --- The proper intent of the contract, and many rites accompanying it, may be seen in the preceding chapters. (Worthington)\f*

\cl Tobias 11
\cd Tobias anointeth his father's eyes with the fish's gall, and he recovereth his sight.
\p
\v 1 And *as they were returning they came to Charan, which is in the midway to Ninive, the eleventh day.
\p
\v 2 And the angel said: Brother Tobias, thou knowest how thou didst leave thy father.
\p
\v 3 If it please thee, therefore, let us go before, and let the family follow softly after us, together with thy wife, and with the beasts.
\p
\v 4 And as this their going pleased him, Raphael said to Tobias: Take with thee of the gall of the fish, for it will be necessary. So Tobias took some of that gall and departed.
\p
\v 5 But Anna sat beside the way daily, on the top of a hill, from whence she might see afar off.
\p
\v 6 And while she watched his coming from that place, she saw him afar off, and presently perceived it was her son coming: and returning, she told her husband, saying: Behold thy son cometh.
\p
\v 7 And Raphael said to Tobias: As soon as thou shalt come into thy house, forthwith adore the Lord, thy God: and giving thanks to him, go to thy father, and kiss him:
\p
\v 8 And immediately anoint his eyes with this gall of the fish, which thou carriest with thee. For be assured that his eyes shall be presently opened, and thy father shall see the light of heaven, and shall rejoice in the sight of thee.
\p
\v 9 Then the dog, which had been with them in the way, ran before, and coming as if he had brought the news, shewed his joy by his fawning and wagging his tail.
\p
\v 10 And his father, that was blind, rising up, began to run, stumbling with his feet: and giving a servant his hand, went to meet his son.
\p
\v 11 And receiving him, kissed him, as did also his wife, and they began to weep for joy.
\p
\v 12 And when they had adored God, and given him thanks, they sat down together.
\p
\v 13 Then Tobias taking of the gall of the fish, anointed his father's eyes.
\p
\v 14 And he stayed about half an hour: and a white skin began to come out of his eyes, like the skin of an egg.
\p
\v 15 And Tobias took hold of it, and drew it from his eyes, and immediately he recovered his sight.
\p
\v 16 And they glorified God, both he and his wife, and all that knew them.
\p
\v 17 And Tobias said: I bless thee, O Lord, God of Israel, because thou hast chastised me, and thou hast saved me: and behold I see Tobias, my son.
\p
\v 18 And after seven days, Sara, his son's wife, and all the family, arrived safe, and the cattle, and the camels, and an abundance of money of his wife's: and that money, also, which he had received of Gabelus:
\p
\v 19 And he told his parents all the benefits of God, which he had done to him by the man that conducted him.
\p
\v 20 And Achior, and Nabath, the kinsmen of Tobias, came, rejoicing for Tobias, and congratulating with him for all the good things that God had done for him.
\p
\v 21 And for seven days they feasted and rejoiced, all with great joy.

\f + \fr 11:1\ft Charan. Not the residence of Abraham, Genesis 12:4. Syriac reads, "Bazri," or "Carrac." Old Vulgate, ibat Caracha, quae est civitas in Ninive. Arrian places Carcha in Assyria, and Ptolemy mentions a Characa in Susiana. --- Midway. At this rate, the distance from Ninive to Ecbatana would be 22 daysâ€™ journey. But it is not half so much for a man travelling expeditiously. (Calmet) --- Tobias had much luggage. Leaving it with his wife, (Haydock) he went from this city to Ninive in three or four days, ver. 18. (Calmet) --- Greek, "And he travelled on till he came near to Ninive. And Raphael said," etc.\f*
\f + \fr 11:3\ft If. Greek, "Let us go quickly before thy wife, and prepare the house." (Haydock) --- This would be necessary, for the reception of so many goods, as well as to relieve the anxiety (Calmet) of the aged parents, and prevent surprise.\f*
\f + \fr 11:4\ft And. Greek, "Take now in thy hand the gall of the fish. And they went on. And the dog followed close up to them; (Haydock; Syriac, "ran before them." Calmet) and Anna."\f*

\f + \fr 11:7\ft To. Greek, "I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes. Anoint, therefore, the gall upon his eyes, and feeling the smart, he will rub and remove the white specks, and shall see thee." (Haydock) --- God. This laudable custom was observed by the ancient solitaries, and prescribed by the rule of St. Benedict, Tobias 53.\f*
\f + \fr 11:9\ft The dog, etc. This may seem a very minute circumstance to be recorded in sacred history; but, as we learn from our Saviour, (St. Matthew 5:18) there are iotas and tittles in the word of God, that is to say, things that appear minute, but which have indeed a deep mysterious meaning in them. (Challoner) --- (Ven. Bede; St. Jerome in Isaias 56:8.; St. Augustine, contra Faust. 22:56.; Worthington) --- The other versions relate this event, ver. 4.\f*
\f + \fr 11:10\ft And. After ver. 7., Greek adds, "and Anna running before, fell upon the neck of her son, and said to him, I have beheld thee, son; henceforth I may die. And they both wept. And Tobit went out towards the door, and he stumbled. But his son ran up to him, and took hold of his father, and spread the gall upon his fatherâ€™s eyes, saying, Have confidence, father. But as soon as they began to smart, he rubbed his eyes, and the white specks came off like skins from the corners: and beholding his son, he fell upon his neck, and wept. Then he said," ver. 17. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 11:14\ft Hour. This is not in the other versions. (Calmet) --- It would intimate that the operation was natural. (Menochius) --- Yet some think that the cure was too instantaneous; (Drusius) or that the miracle consisted in the revelation of a remedy, till then unknown. (Serarius) --- The effect seems to have been of the same nature as that produced by the heart, etc., Tobias 6:8. (Worthington; Calmet) --- Estius believes that the optic nerve was entirely burnt. If the external coat of the eyes was only covered with a sort of skin, it might be removed by the gall of several fishes. (Calmet) --- Callionymi fel cicatrices sanat et carnes oculorum supervacuas consumit. (Pliny, [Natural History?] 32:4. (Menochius)\f*

\f + \fr 11:18\ft Days. Or perhaps hours; (Haydock) as the other versions intimate that Sara arrived the same day. (Calmet) --- Greek, "And his son entered, rejoicing, and related to his father the great things which had taken place in Media. And Tobit went out to meet his daughter-in-law, rejoicing, and blessing God, to the gate of Ninive. And those who saw him walking were astonished, because he saw. And Tobit confessed before them that God had taken pity on him. And as Tobit approached to Sarra, his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, Mayst thou come with safety, daughter. Blessed be God, who has brought thee to us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren at Ninive. And," ver. 20. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 11:20\ft Achior. Greek, "Achiachar," mentioned [in] Tobias 1:24. This text insinuates that he was also styled Anael (Haydock) and Nasbas, and was the nephew of Tobit.

\cd Raphael maketh himself known.
\p
\v 1 Then *Tobias called to him his son, and said to him: What can we give to this holy man that is come with thee?
\p
\v 2 Tobias answering, said to his father: Father, what wages shall we give him? or what can be worthy of his benefits?
\p
\v 3 He conducted me and brought me safe again, he received the money of Gabelus, he caused me to have my wife, and he chased from her the evil spirit, he gave joy to her parents, myself he delivered from being devoured by the fish, thee also he hath made to see the light of heaven, and we are filled with all good things through him. What can we give him sufficient for these things?
\p
\v 4 But I beseech thee, my father, to desire him, that he would vouchsafe to accept of one half of all things that have been brought.
\p
\v 5 So the father and the son calling him, took him aside: and began to desire him that he would vouchsafe to accept of half of all things that they had brought.
\p
\v 6 Then he said to them secretly: Bless ye the God of heaven, give glory to him in the sight of all that live, because he hath shewn his mercy to you.
\p
\v 7 For it is good to hide the secret of a king: but honourable to reveal and confess the works of God.
\p
\v 8 Prayer is good with fasting and alms, more than to lay up treasures of gold:
\p
\v 9 For alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh to find mercy and life everlasting.
\p
\v 10 But they that commit sin and iniquity, are enemies to their own soul.
\p
\v 11 I discover then the truth unto you, and I will not hide the secret from you.
\p
\v 12 When thou didst pray with tears, and didst bury the dead, and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead, by day, in thy house, and bury them by night, I offered thy prayer to the Lord.
\p
\v 13 And because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that temptation should prove thee.
\p
\v 14 And now the Lord hath sent me to heal thee, and to deliver Sara, thy son's wife, from the devil.
\p
\v 15 For I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord.
\p
\v 16 And when they had heard these things, they were troubled, and being seized with fear, they fell upon the ground on their face.
\p
\v 17 And the angel said to them: Peace be to you, fear not.
\p
\v 18 For when I was with you, I was there by the will of God: bless ye him, and sing praises to him.
\p
\v 19 I seemed, indeed, to eat, and to drink with you: but I use an invisible meat and drink, which cannot be seen by men.
\p
\v 20 It is time, therefore, that I return to him that sent me: but bless ye God, and publish all his wonderful works.
\p
\v 21 And when he had said these things, he was taken from their sight, and they could see him no more.
\p
\v 22 Then they lying prostrate for three hours upon their face, blessed God: and rising up, they told all his wonderful works.

\f + \fr 12:1\ft What. Greek, Hebrew and Syriac (Calmet), "See thou give the man who has come with thee his hire, and something must be added to it;" (Haydock) as he had promised (chap. 7:19.) a drachm a day, (Calmet) and more if they returned safe. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:2\ft Said. Greek, "Father, I shall not be hurt if I give him half of what I have brought, since he has conducted me safe back to thee, and has healed my wife, and brought my money, and likewise has cured thee.

\f + \fr 12:7\ft Hide. Greek, "To bless God, and to extol his name, exposing with honour the words of God, and delay not to confess unto him. For," etc. (Haydock) --- The Old Vulgate greatly abridges the remainder of this book, having only, "Then Raphael having called the two Tobies, said to them, Since thou hast not delayed to arise, and to leave thy meals to bury the dead, I have been sent to try thee to heal thee, and to deliver thy daughter-in-law. I am Raphael, one of the angels who assist and appear before the brightness of God. Hereupon the two Tobies were startled, and fell prostrate on the ground, and were seized with fear. And Raphael said, Fear not, Peace be with you. Bless the Lord all the days of your life, and sing his praises. You thought that I eat when I was at table with you. But you saw with your eyes; (Haydock; only a vision, Calmet) wherefore bless the Lord upon the earth, and praise his goodness. As for me, I return to him who sent me. Write down all that has happened. The angel having spoken thus to Tobias, the latter wrote this prayer as a monument of his joy, and said, Blessed be the Lord, who is great in eternity, because his reign endures for ever. It is He who strikes, and who shews mercy, who conducts to the grave, and who, by his majesty, rescues from the greatest miseries; and no one can withdraw himself from his hands. End of Tobias the just." (Haydock) --- King. Secrecy is the soul of human councils, to prevent an enemy from thwarting our designs: but nothing can withstand the divine power. It is therefore proper to testify our gratitude for favours received, as the ancient saints have done by their canticles. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 12:8\ft Alms. Greek adds, "and justice. Better is a little with justice, than much with iniquity." (Haydock) --- Fasting and alms are like the wings of prayer. (Worthington) See Tobias 4:11.\f*
\f + \fr 12:9\ft Everlasting. This word is not found in Greek, though sufficiently implied; as liberality does not always secure a person's life, or temporal happiness. (Calmet) --- Greek, "Those who perform alms-deeds and justice, shall be filled with life. But sinners are enemies," etc.\f*
\f + \fr 12:10\ft Soul. If this were understood of the present life, nothing could be less accurate, as the wicked often prosper. See Psalm 10:6., and John 12:25. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 12:11\ft 1:Greek, "I will not hide from you any word or thing. I said then, It is good to conceal the mystery of the king, but glorious to manifest the works of God. And now, when thou and thy daughter-in-law, Sarra, did pray, I brought forward the memorial of your prayer before the holy one." (Haydock) --- The angels are represented as God's ministers, offering our prayers to him, Apocalypse 8:3. (Calmet) (St. Augustine) (Worthington) --- Philo styles them ambassadors. Socrates says, "every demon (or good spirit) is between God and mortals." (Plutarch) --- Inter homines caelicolasque, vectores hinc precum, inde donorum. (Apuleius de Deo Socrat.) (Calmet) --- Greek continues, "and when thou didst bury the dead, in like manner, I was present with thee; when thou didst not delay to rise and leave thy dinner, that going thou mightest cover the dead; in thy good work, thou wast not hidden from me: but I was with thee. And," etc., ver. 14. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:13\ft Thee. This rule is invariable, that the good may advance in virtue, and set a pattern to the world, (Hebrews 2:18., and 12:6., and Acts 14:21.; Calmet) and cancel their smallest faults.\f*
\f + \fr 12:14\ft From the devil, is not in Greek. (Haydock) --- In this history, as well as in other parts of Scripture, we have convincing proofs of the good which each one receives from his angel guardian, and from the other blessed spirits. See St. Luke xv., and xvi.; St. Chrysostom in col. hom. 3.; St. Augustine, City of God 11:31., etc. (Worthington)\f*

This number is clearly specified by St. John, Apocalypse 1:4. A mass in their honour was approved by Pius 4:It is supposed that the seven deacons in the Church of Rome, and of Jerusalem, were instituted in imitation of them. The kings, Assuerus, etc., had seven chief officers, Esther 1:10. (Calmet) --- Lord, ready to fulfil his orders, as innumerable other angels, of inferior degree, are likewise. (Menochius) (Daniel 7:10.) --- These were the princes of the heavenly court. St. Jerome (contra Jovin.) admits only seven orders of angels. (Calmet) --- Greek, "I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who offer up the prayers of the saints, and go out before the glory of the Holy One. And they were both troubled," etc., (Haydock) at so unusual a thing, (Menochius) and filled with reverential awe. (Haydock) --- They might also suspect that death would shortly follow.

(Haydock) --- Having an aerial body, he made the provisions disappear, as the sun melts snow, Genesis 18:9. (Calmet) --- He might swallow, though he had no need of meat, (St. Augustine, City of God 13:22.) or digestion, (Grotius) so as to convert it into his substance. (Menochius) --- Men.

How many wars have been carried on by Christian potentates, to rescue that favourite spot out of the hands of infidels! all out of respect for Christ.

\p
\v 4 And the rest of his life was in joy, and with great increase of the fear of God he departed in peace.
\p
\v 5 And at the hour of his death he called unto him his son, Tobias, and his children, seven young men, his grandsons, and said to them:
\p
\v 6 The destruction of Ninive is at hand: for the word of the Lord must be fulfilled: *and our brethren, that are scattered abroad from the land of Israel, shall return to it.
\p
\v 7 And all the land thereof, that is desert, shall be filled with people, and the house of God which is burnt in it, shall again be rebuilt: and all that fear God shall return thither.
\p
\v 8 And the Gentiles shall leave their idols, and shall come into Jerusalem, and shall dwell in it,
\p
\v 9 And all the kings of the earth shall rejoice in it, adoring the King of Israel.
\p
\v 10 Hearken, therefore, my children, to your father: serve the Lord in truth, and seek to do the things that please him:
\p
\v 11 And command your children that they do justice and alms-deeds, and that they be mindful of God, and bless him at all times in truth, and with all their power.
\p
\v 12 And now, children, hear me, and do not stay here: but as soon as you shall bury your mother, by me, in one sepulchre, without delay direct your steps to depart hence:
\p
\v 13 For I see that its iniquity will bring it to destruction.
\p
\v 14 And it came to pass, that after the death of his mother, Tobias departed out of Ninive with his wife, and children, and children's children, and returned to his father and mother-in-law.
\p
\v 15 And he found them in health in a good old age: and he took care of them, and he closed their eyes: and all the inheritance of Raguel's house came to him: and he saw his children's children to the fifth generation.
\p
\v 16 And after he had lived ninety-nine years in the fear of the Lord, with joy they buried him.
\p
\v 17 And all his kindred, and all his generation continued in good life, and in holy conversation, so that they were acceptable, both to God, and to men, and to all that dwelt in the land.

Greek, "confession; (or hymn of praise) and he was 58 years old when he lost his sight, which he recovered eight years after, and gave alms, and continued to fear the Lord God, and to confess unto him. Now he arrived at a very advanced age," 158, ver. 10. (Haydock) --- But this chronology must be abandoned. All the versions disagree; and perhaps there may be none perfectly accurate. (Calmet)\f*

Depart into Media, my son, for I believe all that the prophet, Jonas, spoke concerning Ninive, that it will be overturned. But in Media there will be more peace for a time, and that our brethren in the land will be scattered from the good land; and Jerusalem shall be deserted, and the house of God in it will be burnt, and shall be abandoned for a time; and they shall build the house, not like the former, till the times of the world or age be accomplished; and afterwards they shall return from the captives, and shall build Jerusalem gloriously; and the house of God shall be built in it, and the edifice shall be glorious for ever, as the prophets have spoken concerning it; and all the Gentiles shall turn truly to fear the Lord God, and shall undermine (and destroy) their idols; and all the Gentiles shall bless the Lord," etc., (Tobit 14:9.) (Haydock) --- This text is of importance, as it specifies the name of Jonas, and is quoted by St. Jerome; (ibid.) though Nahum and Sophoniash (Nahum 3:8.; Sophonias 2:13.) also foretold the destruction of Ninive. It speaks of the future, and not of the past ruin, of the temple, which certainly took place after the death of Tobias. (Calmet) --- The prophets, however, frequently speak of future events, as if they were past, to shew the certainty of their predictions. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 14:8\ft In it. Let the Jews shew when this was accomplished. We can easily point out the nations converted from idolatry to the Church of Christ, as the prophets foretold, (Jeremias 3:17., Jeremias 16:19.)

\f + \fr 14:9\ft And. Greek, "And his people shall confess to God, and the Lord shall exalt his people, and all shall rejoice who love the Lord God in truth and justice, shewing mercy to our brethren. And now, son, depart from Ninive; for what the prophet, Jonas, spoke, shall surely be accomplished." (Haydock) --- This prediction was conditional, as was also the pardon of the people, who were justly punished for their relapse. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 14:10\ft Seek with diligence, not barely doing what you are commanded. (Haydock) --- Greek is much more diffuse. (Calmet) --- "But do thou keep the law and the ordinances, be a lover of alms-deeds, and just, that it may be well with thee. Bury me with decency, and thy mother with me, and tarry then no longer at Ninive. Son, behold what Aman (Syriac, Acab.) did to Achiachar, who fed him, how he conducted him from light into darkness, and what return he made him. Now, Achiachar met with safety: but he received his due, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and was rescued from the snare of death, which was laid for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished. And now, son, behold the effects of alms-deeds, and how justice brings deliverance. While he was speaking these things, his soul failed upon the bed: but he was 150 years old, and he buried him honourably." (Haydock) --- The allusion to Aman seems improper, he lived many years after the captivity; (Calmet) or rather it may refer to some other history (Houbigant) with which we are not acquainted. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 14:14\ft And. Greek, "And when Anna, his mother, was dead; he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and sons to Ecbatana, to Raguel, his father-in-law, and lived to an honourable old age; and he buried honourably his father and mother-in-law, and he inherited their substance, as well as that of his father, Tobit."

\f + \fr 14:16\ft Nine. Syriac, 107. (Calmet) --- Greek, "But he also died at the age of 127, at Ecbatana, of Media; and he heard, before his death, of the destruction of Ninive, the citizens of which Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus led captives; and he rejoiced over Ninive before he died." We have been more particular in giving the Greek text of this book, because some look upon it as an original; and we should wish to lose no particle of the word of God, which is more precious than gold. Tobias might applaud the execution of divine justice without any private resentment. (Haydock) --- Ninive was taken by Nabuchodonosor, who acted for his father, Nabopolassar, with whom Astyages, king of the Medes, was leagued. They took the city in the reign of Chinaladan, or Sarac, in the year of the world 3378. It also fell a prey to its enemies, under Sardanapalus, in the year 3257; as the inhabitants did not persevere in sentiments of repentance, which they had entertained at the preaching of Jonas, in the reign of Phul. Hence God revealed its destruction to Tobias. (Calmet) --- With joy, may refer to the surviving friends, who rejoiced interiorly at his felicity, while they wept for their own loss; or it may he understood of the deceased; who, like his father, (ver. 4.; Calmet) rejoiced in the Lord, and in performance of good works.\f*
\f + \fr 14:17\ft Kindred. Behold the influence of good example; (Haydock) and a proof that the true religion failed not in Israel, much less in Juda, or the Church of Christ. (Worthington) --- The virtues of these two holy men are truly deserving of applause and imitation. They thought and acted in perfect conformity with the gospel. The father might represent the old law, under all its inconveniences, while the son holds forth the light of Christ, and banishes the devil. (Calmet)\f*
