\imt1 THE PROPHECY OF JEREMIAS.
\im Jeremias was a priest, a native of Anathoth, a priestly city, in the tribe of Benjamin, and was sanctified from his mother's womb to be a prophet of God; which office he began to execute when he was yet a child in age. He was in his whole life, according to the signification of his name, great before the Lord, and a special figure of Jesus Christ, in the persecutions he underwent for discharging his duty, in his charity for his persecutors, and in the violent death he suffered at their hands; it being an ancient tradition of the Hebrews, that he was stoned to death by the remnant of the Jews who had retired into Egypt, (Challoner) at Taphnes. His style is plaintive, (Worthington) like that of Simonides, (Calmet) and not so noble as that of Isaias and Osee. (St. Jerome) --- He was the prophet of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews, predicting many things which befell both, and particularly the liberation of the latter, the year of the world 3485, after the seventy years' captivity, dating from the year of the world 3415, (Calmet) or 3398, the 4th of Joakim. (Usher) (chap. 25.) (Haydock) --- He began to prophesy when he was very young, the year of the world 3375, in the 13th year of Josias, (Calmet) before that prince had brought his reformation to any great perfection. (Haydock)

\cl Jeremias 1
\cd The time and the calling of Jeremias: his prophetical visions. God encourages him.
\p
\v 1 The words of Jeremias, the son of Helcias, of the priests that were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin.
\p
\v 2 The word of the Lord, which came to him in the days of Josias, the son of Amon, king of Juda, in the thirteenth year *of his reign.
\p
\v 3 And which came to him in the days of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda, unto the end of the eleventh year of Sedecias, the son of Josias, king of Juda, even unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.
\p
\v 4 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 5 Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother, I knew thee: and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and made thee a prophet unto the nations.
\p
\v 6 And I said: Ah, ah, ah, Lord God: behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child.
\p
\v 7 And the Lord said to me: Say not: I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee: and whatsoever I shall command thee, thou shalt speak.
\p
\v 8 Be not afraid at their presence: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 9 And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth: *and the Lord said to me: Behold, I have given my words in thy mouth:
\p
\v 10 Lo, I have set thee this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms, *to root up, and pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build, and to plant.
\p
\v 11 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said: I see a rod watching.
\p
\v 12 And the Lord said to me: Thou hast seen well: for I will watch over my word to perform it.
\p
\v 13 And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying: What seest thou? And I said: *I see a boiling caldron, and the face thereof from the face of the north.
\p
\v 14 And the Lord said to me: *From the north shall an evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
\p
\v 15 For behold I will call together all the families of the kingdoms of the north: saith the Lord: and they shall come, and shall set every one his throne in the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all the walls thereof round about, and upon all the cities of Juda.
\p
\v 16 And I will pronounce my judgements against them, touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, and have adored the work of their own hands.
\p
\v 17 Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. Be not afraid at their presence: for I will make thee not to fear their countenance.
\p
\v 18 *For behold I have made thee this day a fortified city, and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings of Juda, to the princes thereof, and to the priests, and to the people of the land.
\p
\v 19 And they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.

\f + \fr 1:3\ft Joakim. His immediate predecessor and successor, both called Jechonias, (Haydock) are passed over, as their reign was short, (Calmet) only lasting three months each. (Haydock) --- Fifth. Jerusalem was taken on the 9th of the preceding month. But the temple was not burnt, nor the captives sent off till the fifth month, or the 10th of the civil year, Jeremias 39:8., and 52:13., and 4 Kings 25:2.

\f + \fr 1:5\ft Knew, with affection, and designed thee for this office from eternity. Many think (Calmet) that Jeremias was purified from original sin before his birth. (St. Augustine) --- He had this privilege, and was also a priest, prophet, virgin, and martyr. (Worthington) --- Yet to sanctify, often means only to set aside, Exodus 13:2., and Ecclesiasticus 49:9. --- Nations, whose overthrow he points out, Jeremias 25:27, 44, etc. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:6\ft Ah. Hebrew ahah. Septuagint, "thou Being." Protestants, "Then said I: Ah, Lord God." (Haydock) --- He does not imitate a child.

(Theodoret) (Pliny, [Natural History?] 16:25.) --- Thus God will speedily send his scourge from Babylon, to punish his people. (Calmet) ---The sense is the same.

\f + \fr 1:13\ft North, whence the wind blows, to make the fire burn more intensely.

\cl Jeremias 2
\cd God expostulates with the Jews for their ingratitude and infidelity.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: I have remembered thee, pitying thy youth, and the love of thy espousals, when thou followedst me in the desert, in a land that is not sown.
\p
\v 3 Israel is holy to the Lord, the first-fruits of his increase: all they that devour him, offend: evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 4 Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all ye families of the house of Israel.
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord: *What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
\p
\v 6 And they have not said: Where is the Lord, that made us come up out of the land of Egypt? that led us through the desert, through a land uninhabited and unpassable, through a land of drought, and the image of death, through a land, wherein no man walked, nor any man dwelt?
\p
\v 7 And I brought you into the land of Carmel, to eat the fruit thereof, and the best things thereof: and when ye entered in, you defiled my land, and made my inheritance an abomination.
\p
\v 8 The priests did not say: Where is the Lord? and they that held the law knew me not, and the pastors transgressed against me: and the prophets prophesied in Baal, and followed idols.
\p
\v 9 Therefore will I yet contend in judgement with you, saith the Lord, and I will plead with your children.
\p
\v 10 Pass over to the isles of Cethim, and see: and send into Cedar, and consider diligently: and see if there hath been done any thing like this.
\p
\v 11 If a nation hath changed their gods, and indeed they are not gods: but my people have changed their glory into an idol.
\p
\v 12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and ye gates thereof, be very desolate, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 13 For my people have done two evils: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\p
\v 14 Is Israel a bondman, or a home-born slave? why then is he become a prey?
\p
\v 15 The lions have roared upon him, and have made a noise, they have made his land a wilderness: his cities are burnt down, and there is none to dwell in them.
\p
\v 16 The children also of Memphis, and of Taphnes have deflowered thee, even to the crown of the head.
\p
\v 17 Hath not this been done to thee, because thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God at that time, when he led thee by the way?
\p
\v 18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled water? And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of the river?
\p
\v 19 Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostacy shall rebuke thee. Know thou, and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee, to have left the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not with thee, saith the Lord, the God of hosts.
\p
\v 20 Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve. *For on every high hill, and under every green tree, thou didst prostitute thyself.
\p
\v 21 *Yet I planted thee a chosen vineyard, all true seed: how then art thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing, O strange vineyard?
\p
\v 22 Though thou wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to thyself the herb borith, thou art stained in thy iniquity before me, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 23 How canst thou say: I am not polluted, and I have not walked after Baalim? see thy ways in the valley, know what thou hast done: as a swift runner pursuing his course.
\p
\v 24 A wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of his heart, snuffed up the wind of his love: none shall turn her away: all that seek her shall not fail: in her monthly filth they shall find her.
\p
\v 25 Keep thy foot from being bare, and thy throat from thirst. But thou saidst: I have lost all hope, I will not do it: for I have loved strangers, and I will walk after them.
\p
\v 26 As the thief is confounded when he is taken, so is the house of Israel confounded, they and their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.
\p
\v 27 Saying to a stock: Thou art my father: and to a stone: Thou hast begotten me: *they have turned their back to me, and not their face: and in the time of their affliction they will say: Arise, and deliver us.
\p
\v 28 Where are thy gods, whom thou hast made thee? let them arise and deliver thee in the time of thy affliction: *for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda.
\p
\v 29 Why will you contend with me in judgement? you have all forsaken me, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 30 In vain have I struck your children, they have not received correction: your sword hath devoured your prophets, your generation is like a ravaging lion.
\p
\v 31 See ye the word of the Lord: Am I become a wilderness to Israel, or a lateward springing land? why then have my people said: We are revolted, we will come to thee no more?
\p
\v 32 Will a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her stomacher? but my people hath forgotten me days without number.
\p
\v 33 Why dost thou endeavor to shew thy way good to seek my love, thou who has also taught thy malices to be thy ways.
\p
\v 34 And in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor and innocent? not in ditches have I found them, but in all places, which I mentioned before.
\p
\v 35 And thou hast said: I am without sin, and am innocent: and therefore let thy anger be turned away from me. Behold, I will contend with thee in judgement, because thou hast said: I have not sinned.
\p
\v 36 How exceedingly base art thou become, going the same ways over again! and thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
\p
\v 37 For from thence thou shalt go, and thy hand shall be upon thy head: for the Lord hath destroyed thy trust, and thou shalt have nothing prosperous therein.

\f + \fr 2:2\ft Espousals. He speaks ironically. (Theodoret) --- Yet the Israelites at first shewed greater proofs of love than they did afterwards. It is true they often prevaricated, in the wilderness, Exodus 32:1., and Amos 5:25., and Psalm lxxvii., etc. (Calmet) --- The Lord declares his gratuitous love, and then upbraids his people. (Haydock) --- He had caused them to multiply in Egypt, and gratuitously made choice of them. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:3\ft Increase; most desirable, Osee 9:10. God punished those who attempted to injure his people: yet they abandoned his service.\f*

\f + \fr 2:8\ft Priests were silent, or abandoned themselves. --- Pastors; "princes." (Chaldean) Manasses, Amon, etc. --- In Baal, promoting his worship. (Haydock) --- The land was full of false prophets, and none stood up for the Lord.\f*
\f + \fr 2:9\ft Children; the Israelites, under Moses, and their posterity transgressed.\f*
\f + \fr 2:10\ft Cethim; Macedon. It here denotes the western nations, as Cedar does those on the east.\f*
\f + \fr 2:11\ft Glory; the true God and his ark, Psalm 3:4., and 1 Kings 4:21.\f*
\f + \fr 2:12\ft Gates; angels, or the temple.\f*
\f + \fr 2:13\ft Water. The idols and nations, to which they have had recourse, injure them. (Calmet) --- The Jews did just the reverse to what God commanded. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:14\ft Slave. From such, labour and tribute were required, Matthew 17:24., and John 8:33.\f*

\f + \fr 2:16\ft Taphnes, 16 miles from Pelusium, in Egypt. The nation proved only detrimental to the Jews, by engaging them in their abominations, instead of affording relief.\f*
\f + \fr 2:18\ft Troubled. Hebrew shichor, or Nile water, (Josue 13:3.) which was thought as good as wine, and grew better for keeping. (Strabo xvii.) --- Hence the people adored it. (Vitruvius viii.) --- God often reproached the Jews for distrusting in his protection, and seeking aid from the Egyptians, who deceived them. We know not that Josias did so. (Calmet) --- He even opposed them, and lost his life in defending the country, 4 Kings 23:29. (Haydock) --- He was probably obliged to pay tribute to the Assyrians, whom Achaz had called in, 2 Paralipomenon 28:23. These alliances the Lord condemned.\f*
\f + \fr 2:20\ft Thou. Septuagint. Yet Hebrew and Chaldean have, "I have permissively broken," or foretold this infidelity.\f*
\f + \fr 2:21\ft Chosen. Hebrew, Sorek, Judges 16:4., and Isaias 5:2., and 16:8. (Calmet) --- God created all things good, planted his Church in justice, and no evil proceeds from Him. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:22\ft Borith. An herb used to clean clothes, and take out spots and dirt, (Challoner) like kali, soda, (Calmet) or soap. (Langius.) --- Protestants, "and take thee much soap." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:23\ft Valley of Hinnom, under the very walls of Jerusalem. (Calmet) --- Runner. Hebrew, "dromedary," which takes its name from its swiftness. (Haydock) --- The female camel continues all day with the male, and cannot be approached. (Aristotle; Pliny, [Natural History?] 10:63.) --- Juda is represented as no less libidinous. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:24\ft Away. The female may easily be found by the poisonous hippo-manes. (Georg. iii.) --- Thus Jerusalem is an impudent prostitute. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:25\ft Foot, and the parts which modesty covers. My exhortations are slighted. (Calmet) --- Despair opens the door to every sort of impurity, Ephesians 4:19. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:26\ft Taken. Juda affected still to be very pious, ver. 23.\f*
\f + \fr 2:28\ft Cities. All were abandoned, Ezechiel 16:24., and Osee 10:1.\f*
\f + \fr 2:30\ft Prophets; Zacharias, (2 Paralipomenon 24:21.) Isaias, etc., Matthew 23:34. (Calmet) --- Punishment is designed by God to cause people to repent. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:31\ft See, or hear. The sword seems to be animated. (Calmet) --- Lateward. Hebrew, "darksome land." Have I not heaped blessings on my people? --- Revolted. Protestants, "Lords." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:33\ft Thou who. Hebrew, "Therefore have I." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways." (Haydock) --- Thou hast opened a school of vice.\f*
\f + \fr 2:34\ft Innocent children, immolated to Moloc, or people murdered, whose blood thou hast not concealed, 4 Kings 21:16.\f*
\f + \fr 2:37\ft Head, like the violated Thamar, 2 Kings 13:19. The king of Egypt was routed, when coming to assist Sedecias, Jeremias 37:3, 10. (Calmet)\f*

\cl Jeremias 3
\cd God invites the rebel Jews to return to him, with a promise to receive them: he foretells the conversion of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 1 It is commonly said: If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and marry another man, shall he return to her any more? shall not that woman be polluted, and defiled? but thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers: nevertheless return to me, saith the Lord, and I will receive thee.
\p
\v 2 Lift up thy eyes on high: and see where thou hast not prostituted thyself: thou didst sit in the ways, waiting for them, as a robber in the wilderness: and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications, and with thy wickedness.
\p
\v 3 Therefore, the showers were withholden, and there was no lateward rain: thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou wouldst not blush.
\p
\v 4 Therefore, at the least, from this time, call to me: Thou art my father, the guide of my virginity:
\p
\v 5 Wilt thou be angry for ever, or wilt thou continue until the end? Behold, thou hast spoken, and hast done evil things, and hast been able.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said to me in the days of king Josias: *Hast thou seen what rebellious Israel hash done? she hath gone out of herself upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and hath played the harlot there.
\p
\v 7 And when she had done all these things, I said: Return to me, and she did not return. And her treacherous sister, Juda, saw,
\p
\v 8 That because the rebellious Israel had played the harlot, I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce: yet her treacherous sister, Juda, was not afraid, but went and played the harlot also herself.
\p
\v 9 And by the facility of her fornication she defiled the land, and played the harlot with stones and with stocks.
\p
\v 10 And after all this, her treacherous sister, Juda, hath not returned to me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 11 And the Lord said to me: The rebellious Israel hath justified her soul in comparison of the treacherous Juda.
\p
\v 12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and thou shalt say: Return, O rebellious Israel, saith the Lord, and I will not turn away my face from you: for I am holy, saith the Lord, and I will not be angry for ever.
\p
\v 13 But yet, acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God: and thou hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and hast not heard my voice, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 14 Return, O ye revolting children, saith the Lord: for I am your husband: and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a kindred, and will bring you into Sion.
\p
\v 15 And I will give you pastors, according to my own heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine.
\p
\v 16 And when you shall be multiplied, and increase in the land in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more: The ark of the covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come upon the heart, neither shall they remember it, neither shall it be visited, neither shall that be done any more.
\p
\v 17 At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord: and all the nations shall be gathered together to it, in the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem, and they shall not walk after the perversity of their most wicked heart.
\p
\v 18 In those days the house of Juda shall go to the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land which I gave to your fathers.
\p
\v 19 But I said: How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a lovely land, the goodly inheritance of the armies of the Gentiles? And I said: Thou shalt call me father, and shalt not cease to walk after me.
\p
\v 20 But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the house of Israel despised me, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 21 A voice was heard in the high ways, weeping and howling of the children of Israel: because they have made their way wicked, they have forgotten the Lord their God.
\p
\v 22 Return, you rebellious children, and I will heal your rebellions. Behold, we come to thee: for thou art the Lord our God.
\p
\v 23 In very deed the hills were liars, and the multitude of the mountains: truly, in the Lord our God, is the salvation of Israel.
\p
\v 24 Confusion hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
\p
\v 25 We shall sleep in our confusion, and our shame shall cover us, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth, even to this day: and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.

But the people were less favoured than Juda, which had many prophets and good kings, the temple, etc. Moreover, the misfortunes of Israel did not open the eyes of their brethren. (Calmet) --- Both the ten tribes, and the two tribes (Worthington) which adhered to the line of David, prevaricated. (Haydock)\f*

\f + \fr 3:16\ft Ark. It was no longer at Jerusalem. The law and its figures cease.\f*

\cl Jeremias 4
\cd An admonition to sincere repentance, and circumcision of the heart, with threats of grievous punishment to those that persist in sin.
\p
\v 1 If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return to me: if thou wilt take away thy stumbling-blocks out of my sight, thou shalt not be moved.
\p
\v 2 And thou shalt swear: As the Lord liveth, in truth, and in judgement, and in justice: and the Gentiles shall bless him, and shall praise him.
\p
\v 3 For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and Jerusalem: *Break up anew your fallow ground, and sow not upon thorns:
\p
\v 4 Be circumcised to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my indignation come forth like fire, and burn, and there be none that can quench it: because of the wickedness of your thoughts.
\p
\v 5 Declare ye in Juda, and make it heard in Jerusalem: speak, and sound with the trumpet in the land: cry aloud, and say: Assemble yourselves, and let us go into strong cities.
\p
\v 6 Set up the standard in Sion. Strengthen yourselves, stay not, *for I bring evil from the north, and great destruction.
\p
\v 7 The lion is come up out of his den, and the robber of nations hath roused himself: he is come forth out of his place, to make thy land desolate: thy cities shall be laid waste, remaining without an inhabitant.
\p
\v 8 For this, gird yourselves with hair-cloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us.
\p
\v 9 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord: That the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes: and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed
\p
\v 10 And I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, hast thou then deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying: You shall have peace: and behold the sword reacheth even to the soul?
\p
\v 11 At that time it shall be said to this people, and to Jerusalem: A burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of the way of the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse.
\p
\v 12 A full wind from these places shall come to me: and now I will speak my judgments with them.
\p
\v 13 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles: woe unto us, for we are laid waste.
\p
\v 14 Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayst be saved: how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee?
\p
\v 15 For a voice of one declaring from Dan, and giving notice of the idol from Mount Ephraim.
\p
\v 16 Say ye to the nations: Behold, it is heard in Jerusalem, that guards are coming from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Juda.
\p
\v 17 They are set round about her, as keepers of fields: because she hath provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 18 *Thy ways and thy devices have brought these things upon thee: this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it hath touched thy heart.
\p
\v 19 My bowels, my bowels are in pain, the senses of my heart are troubled within me, I will not hold my peace, for my soul hath heard the sound of the trumpet, the cry of battle.
\p
\v 20 Destruction upon destruction is called for, and all the earth is laid waste: my tents are destroyed on a sudden, and my pavilions in a moment.
\p
\v 21 How long shall I see men fleeing away, how long shall I hear the sound of the trumpet?
\p
\v 22 For my foolish people have not known me: they are foolish and senseless children: they are wise to do evils, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\p
\v 23 I beheld the earth, and lo it was void, and nothing: and the heavens, and there was no light in them.
\p
\v 24 I looked upon the mountains, and behold they trembled: and all the hills were troubled.
\p
\v 25 I beheld, and lo there was no man: and all the birds of the air were gone.
\p
\v 26 I looked, and behold Carmel was a wilderness: and all its cities were destroyed at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of the wrath of his indignation.
\p
\v 27 For thus saith the Lord: All the land shall be desolate, but yet I will not utterly destroy.
\p
\v 28 The earth shall mourn, and the heavens shall lament from above: because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I have not repented, neither am I turned away from it.
\p
\v 29 At the voice of the horsemen, and the archer, all the city is fled away: they have entered into thickets, and have climbed up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a man in them.
\p
\v 30 But when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with stibic-stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain: thy lovers have despised thee, they will seek thy life.
\p
\v 31 For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail; anguishes, as of a woman in labour of a child. The voice of the daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands: Woe is me, for my soul hath fainted because of them that are slain.

\cd The judgments of God shall fall upon the Jews for their manifold sins.
\p
\v 1 Go about, through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and consider, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can fins a man that executeth judgement, and seeketh faith: and I will be merciful unto it.
\p
\v 2 And though they say: The Lord liveth; this also they will swear falsely.
\p
\v 3 O Lord, thy eyes are upon truth: thou hast struck them, and they have not grieved: thou hast bruised them, and they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, and they have refused to return.
\p
\v 4 But I said: Perhaps these are poor and foolish, that know not the way of the Lord, the judgement of their God.
\p
\v 5 I will go therefore to the great men, and I will speak to them: for they have known the way of the Lord, the judgement of their God: and, behold, these have altogether broken the yoke more, and have burst the bonds.
\p
\v 6 Wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them, a wolf in the evening hath spoiled them, a leopard watcheth for their cities: every one that shall go out thence, shall be taken, because their transgressions are multiplied, their rebellions are strengthened.
\p
\v 7 How can I be merciful to thee? thy children have forsaken me, and swear by them that are not gods: I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and rioted in the harlot's house.
\p
\v 8 They are become as amorous horses and stallions: *every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.
\p
\v 9 Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord? and shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?
\p
\v 10 Scale the walls thereof, and throw them down, but do not utterly destroy: take away the branches thereof, because they are not the Lord's.
\p
\v 11 For the house of Israel, and the house of Juda, have greatly transgressed against me, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 12 They have denied the Lord, and said, It is not he: and the evil shall not come upon us: we shall not see the sword and famine.
\p
\v 13 The prophets have spoken in the wind, and there was no word of God in them: these things therefore shall befall them.
\p
\v 14 Thus saith the Lord, the God of hosts: Because you have spoken this word: behold, I will make my words in thy mouth as fire, and this people as wood, and it shall devour them.
\p
\v 15 Behold, I will bring upon you a nation from afar, O house of Israel, saith the Lord: a strong nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou shalt not know, nor understand what they say.
\p
\v 16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all valiant.
\p
\v 17 And they shall eat up thy corn, and thy bread: they shall devour thy sons, and thy daughters: they shall eat up thy flocks, and thy herds: they shall eat thy vineyards, and thy figs: and with the sword they shall destroy thy strong cities, wherein thou trusteth.
\p
\v 18 Nevertheless, in those days, saith the Lord, I will not bring you to utter destruction.
\p
\v 19 *And if you shall say: Why hath the Lord our God done all these things to us? thou shalt say to them: As you have forsaken me, and served a strange god in your own land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not your own.
\p
\v 20 Declare ye this to the house of Jacob, and publish it in Juda, saying:
\p
\v 21 Hear, O foolish people, and without understanding: who have eyes, and see not: and ears, and hear not.
\p
\v 22 Will not you then fear me, saith the Lord? and will you not repent at my presence? I have set the sand a bound for the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it shall not pass over: and the waves thereof shall toss themselves, and shall not prevail: they shall swell, and shall not pass over it.
\p
\v 23 But the heart of this people is become hard of belief, and provoking, they are revolted and gone away.
\p
\v 24 And they have not said in their heart: Let us fear the Lord our God, who giveth us the early and the latter rain in due season: who preserveth for us the fulness of the yearly harvest.
\p
\v 25 Your iniquities have turned these things away, and your sins have withholden good things from you.
\p
\v 26 For among my people are found wicked men, that lie in wait as fowlers, setting snares and traps to catch men.
\p
\v 27 As a net is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit: therefore are they become great and enriched.
\p
\v 28 They are grown gross and fat: and have most wickedly transgressed my words. *They have not judged the cause of the widow; they have not managed the cause of the fatherless, they have not judged the judgement of the poor.
\p
\v 29 Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord? or shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?
\p
\v 30 Astonishing and wonderful things have been done in the land.
\p

\p
\v 1 Strengthen yourselves, ye sons of Benjamin, in the midst of Jerusalem, and sound the trumpet in Thecua, and set up the standard over Bethacarem: for evil is seen out of the north, and a great destruction.
\p
\v 2 I have likened the daughter of Sion to a beautiful and delicate woman.
\p
\v 3 The shepherds shall come to her with their flocks: they have pitched their tents against her round about: every one shall feed them that are under his hand.
\p
\v 4 Prepare ye war against her: arise, and let us go up at mid-day: woe unto us, for the day is declined, for the shadows of the evening are grown longer.
\p
\v 5 Arise, and let us go up in the night, and destroy her houses.
\p
\v 6 For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Hew down her trees, cast up a trench about Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited, all oppression is in the midst of her.
\p
\v 7 As a cistern maketh its water cold, so hath she made her wickedness cold: violence and spoil shall be heard in her, infirmity and stripes are continually before me.
\p
\v 8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee, lest I make thee desolate, a land uninhabited.
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall gather the remains of Israel, as in a vine, even to one cluster: turn back thy hand, as a grape-gatherer into the basket.
\p
\v 10 To whom shall I speak? and to whom shall I testify, that he may hear? behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hear: behold, the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach: and and they will not receive it.
\p
\v 11 Therefore am I full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the child abroad, and upon the council of the young men together: for man and woman shall be taken, the ancient, and he that is full of days.
\p
\v 12 And their houses shall be turned over to others, with their lands and their wives together: for I will stretch for my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 13 *For from the least of them even to the greatest, all are given to covetousness: and from the prophet even to the priest, all are guilty of deceit.
\p
\v 14 And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: and there was no peace.
\p
\v 15 They were confounded, because they commmitted abomination: yea, rather they were not confounded with confusion, and they knew not how to blush: wherefore they shall fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall fall down, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the Lord: Stand ye on the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, which is the good way, and walk ye in it: *and you shall find refreshment for your souls. And they said: We will not walk.
\p
\v 17 And I appointed watchmen over you, saying: Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet. And they said: We will not hearken.
\p
\v 18 Therefore, hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what great things I will do to them.
\p
\v 19 Hear, O earth: Behold, I will bring evils upon this people, the fruit of their own thoughts: because they have not heard my words, and they have cast away my law.
\p
\v 20 *To what purpose do you bring me frankincense from Saba, and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? your holocausts are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.
\p
\v 21 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will bring destruction upon this people, by which fathers and sons together shall fall, neighbour and kinsman shall perish.
\p
\v 22 Thus saith the Lord: Behold a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 23 They shall lay hold on arrow and shield: they are cruel, and will have no mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea: and they shall mount upon horses, prepared as men for war, against thee, O daughter of Sion.
\p
\v 24 We have heard the fame thereof, our hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, as a woman in labor.
\p
\v 25 Go not out into the fields, nor walk in the highway: for the sword of the enemy, and fear is on every side.
\p
\v 26 Gird thee with sackcloth, O daughter of my people, and sprinkle thee with ashes: make thee mourning as for an only son, a bitter lamentation, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
\p
\v 27 I have set thee for a strong trier among my people: and thou shalt know, and prove their way.
\p
\v 28 All these princes go out of the way, they walk deceitfully, they are brass and iron: they are all corrupted.
\p
\v 29 The bellows have failed, the lead is consumed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed.

\v 9 To steal, to murder, to commit adultery, to swear falsely, to offer to Baalim, and to go after strange gods, which you know not.
\p
\v 10 And you have come, and stood before me in this house, in which my name is called upon, and have said: We are delivered, because we have done all these abominations.
\p
\v 11 *Is this house then, in which my name hath been called upon, in your eyes become a den of robbers? I, I am he: I have seen it, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 12 Go ye to my place in Silo, where my name dwelt from the beginning: and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel:
\p
\v 13 And now, because you have done all these works, saith the Lord: and I have spoken to you rising up early, and speaking, and you have not heard: *and I have called you, and you have not answered:
\p
\v 14 *I will do to this house, in which my name is called upon, and in which you trust, and to the place which I have given you and your fathers, as I did to Silo.
\p
\v 15 And I will cast you away from before my face, as I have cast away all your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim.
\p
\v 16 *Therefore do not thou pray for this people, nor take to thee praise and supplication for them, and do not withstand me: for I will not hear thee.
\p
\v 17 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\p
\v 18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to offer libations to strange gods, and to provoke me to anger.
\p
\v 19 Do they provoke me to anger, saith the Lord? is it not themselves, to the confusion of their own countenance?
\p
\v 20 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, my wrath and my indignation is enkindled against this place, upon men and upon beasts, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruits of the land, and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat ye the flesh.
\p
\v 22 For I spoke not to your fathers, and I commanded them not, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning the matter of burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
\p
\v 23 But this thing I commanded them, saying: Hearken to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people: and walk ye in all the way, that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.
\p
\v 24 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear: but walked in their own will, and in the perversity of their wicked heart: and went backward and not forward,
\p
\v 25 From the day that their fathers came out of the land of Egypt, even to this day. And I have sent to you all my servants, the prophets, from day to day, rising up early and sending.
\p
\v 26 And they have not hearkened to me: nor inclined their ear: but have hardened their neck, *and have done worse than their fathers.
\p
\v 27 And thou shalt speak to them all these words, but they will not hearken to thee: and thou shalt call them, but they will not answer thee.
\p
\v 28 And thou shalt say to them: This is a nation which hath not hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, nor received instruction: faith is lost, and is taken away out of their mouth.
\p
\v 29 Cut off thy hair, and cast it away: and take up a lamentation on high: for the Lord hath rejected, and forsaken the generation of his wrath,
\p
\v 30 Because the children of Juda have done evil in my eyes, saith the Lord. They have set their abominations in the house in which my name is called upon, to pollute it:
\p
\v 31 And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, to burn their sons, and their daughters, in the fire: which I commanded not, nor thought on in my heart.
\p
\v 32 Therefore, behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and it shall no more be called Topheth, nor the Valley of the son of Ennom: but the Valley of slaughter, and they shall bury in Topheth, because there is no place.
\p
\v 33 And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and there shall be none to drive them away.
\p
\v 34 *And I will cause to cease out of the cities of Juda, and out of the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.

Abraham and Moses did not leave off praying for the guilty, (Genesis 18:23., and Exodus 32:10.) and the Lord complains that there was none to withhold him, Isaias 64:7., and Ezechiel 22:30.

\f + \fr 7:22\ft I commanded them not: viz., such sacrifices as the Jews at this time offered without obedience; which was the thing principally commanded: so that in comparison with it, the offering of the holocausts and sacrifices was of small account. (Challoner) --- The observance of the decalogue would suffice. Victims were to teach internal piety, Leviticus 1. (Worthington) --- God "brought them out of Egypt, not for the sake of their sacrifices, but that they might....hear his word." (St. Irenaeus, [Against Heresies] 4:17.) --- This was the principal design. See Matthew 9:13., and Osee 6:6., and 1 Corinthians 1:17. (Maldonat) (Menochius) (Calmet) --- The rules for sacrifices were given after the adoration of the calf, as necessary preservatives against idolatry. (St. Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologica] 1:2. q. 102. a. 3.) --- Yet the paschal lamb, etc., had been already commanded. (Calmet) --- Many such absolute expressions imply a condition or comparison. (Gloss.) (Proverbs 8:10.) --- I brought. Several manuscripts read thus more accurately than the Hebrew, "He brought," (Kennicott) which Protestants abandon, (Haydock) though the present reading may stand. (Chappel.) (Crat.) --- Every variation should be noticed, as this and the former verse "seem greatly corrupted; perhaps the Syriac version will be the best guide to their true meaning." (Kennicott) --- Yet the passage is sufficiently intelligible in the Vulgate and Septuagint.\f*
\f + \fr 7:27\ft Thee. Septuagint omit this verse, which Grabe replaces. The people will be more inexcusable. (Haydock)\f*

\f + \fr 7:30\ft Abominations. Hebrew. We have literally, "stumbling-blocks," offendicula. (Haydock) --- Manasses placed idols in the very temple, as the last kings of Juda did, 4 Kings 23:4., and Ezechiel 8:3.\f*
\f + \fr 7:31\ft Valley, to the south of the city. Here Moloc was adored, and Josias therefore contaminated the place, 4 Kings 23:10. (Calmet) --- It was very delightful. (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 7:32\ft Place, elsewhere. (Haydock) --- This was verified when Nabuchodonosor and Titus besieged the city. (Calmet) --- The latter was quite shocked. (Josephus, Jewish Wars 6:14.) See Jeremias 19., and 31:40.\f*

\cd Other evils that shall fall upon the Jews for their impenitence.
\p
\v 1 At that time, saith the Lord, they shall cast out the bones of the kings of Juda, and the bones of the princes thereof, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.
\p
\v 2 And they shall spread them abroad to the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and adored: they shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried: they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth.
\p
\v 3 And death shall be chosen rather than life, by all that shall remain of this wicked kindred in all places, which are left, to which I have cast them out, saith the Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Shall not he that falleth, rise again? and he that is turned away, shall he not turn again?
\p
\v 5 Why then is this people in Jerusalem turned away with a stubborn revolting? they have laid hold on lying, and have refused to return.
\p
\v 6 I attended, and hearkened: no man speaketh what is good, there is none that doth penance for his sin, saying: What have I done? They are all turned to their own course, as a horse rushing to the battle.
\p
\v 7 The kite in the air hath known her time: the turtle, and the swallow, and the stork have observed the time of their coming: but my people have not known the judgment of the Lord.
\p
\v 8 How do you say: We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Indeed, the lying pen of the scribes hath wrought falsehood.
\p
\v 9 The wise men are confounded, they are dismayed, and taken: for they have cast away the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them.
\p
\v 10 *Therefore will I give their women to strangers, their fields to others for an inheritance: because from the least, even to the greatest, all follow covetousness: from the prophet, even to the priest, all deal deceitfully.
\p
\v 11 And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: when there was no peace.
\p
\v 12 They are confounded, because they have committed abomination: yea, rather, they are not confounded with confusion, and they have not know how to blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall fall, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Gathering, I will gather them together, saith the Lord: there is no grape on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig-tree, the leaf is fallen: and I have given them the things that are passed away.
\p
\v 14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced city, and let us be silent there: for the Lord our God hath put us to silence, and hath given us *water of gall to drink: for we have sinned against the Lord.
\p

\p

\cd The prophet laments the miseries of his people: and their sins, which are the cause of them. He exhorts them to repentance.
\p
\v 1 Who will give water to my head, and a fountain of tears to my eyes? and I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.
\p
\v 2 Who will give me in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, and I will leave my people, and depart from them? because they are all adulterers, an assembly of transgressors.
\p
\v 3 And they have bent their tongue, as a bow, for lies, and not for truth: they have strengthened themselves upon the earth, for they have proceeded from evil to evil, and me they have not known, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 4 Let every man take heed of his neighbour, and let him not trust in any brother of his: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully.
\p
\v 5 And a man shall mock his brother, and they will not speak the truth: for they have taught their tongue to speak lies: they have laboured to commit iniquity.
\p
\v 6 Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit: through deceit they have refused to know me, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 7 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will melt, and try them: for what else shall I do before the daughter of my people?
\p
\v 8 *Their tongue is a piercing arrow, it hath spoken deceit: with his mouth one speaketh peace with his friend, and secretly he lieth in wait for him.
\p
\v 9 Shall I not visit them for these things, saith the Lord? or shall not my soul be revenged on such a nation?
\p
\v 10 For the mountains I will take up weeping and lamentation, and for the beautiful places of the desert, mourning: because they are burnt up, for that there is not a man that passeth through them: and they have not heard the voice of the owner: from the fowl of the air to the beasts, they are gone away and departed.
\p
\v 11 And I will make Jerusalem to be heaps of sand, and dens of dragons: and I will make the cities of Juda desolate, for want of an inhabitant.
\p
\v 12 Who is the wise man, that may understand this, and to whom the word of the mouth of the Lord may come, that he may declare this, why the land hath perished, and is burnt up like a wilderness, which none passeth through?
\p
\v 13 And the Lord said: Because they have forsaken my law, which I gave them, and have not heard my voice, and have not walked in it.
\p
\v 14 But they have gone after the perverseness of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them.
\p
\v 15 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: *Behold I will feed this people with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
\p
\v 16 And I will scatter them among the nations, which they and their fathers have not known: and I will send the sword after them, till they be consumed.
\p
\v 17 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, and let them come: and send to them that are wise women, and let them make haste:
\p
\v 18 Let them hasten, and take up a lamentation for us: let our eyes shed tears, and our eyelids run down with waters.
\p
\v 19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Sion: How are we wasted and greatly confounded? because we have left the land, because our dwellings are cast down.
\p
\v 20 Hear therefore, ye women, the word of the Lord: and let your ears receive the word of his mouth: and teach your daughters wailing: and every one her neighbour mourning.
\p
\v 21 For death is come up through our windows, it is entered into our houses, to destroy the children from without, the young men from the streets.
\p
\v 22 Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Even the carcass of man shall fall as dung upon the face of the country, and as grass behind the back of the mower, and there is none to gather it.
\p
\v 23 Thus saith the Lord: *Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man glory in his strength, and let not the rich man glory in his riches:
\p
\v 24 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, for I am the Lord that exercise mercy, and judgment, and justice in the earth: for these things please me, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit upon every one that hath the foreskin circumcised.
\p
\v 26 Upon Egypt, and upon Juda, and upon Edom, and upon the children of Ammon, and upon Moab, and upon all that have their hair polled round, that dwell in the desert: for all the nations are uncircumcised in the flesh, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.

\v 9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.
\p
\v 10 But the Lord is the true God: he is the living God, and the everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.
\p
\v 11 Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under heaven.
\p
\v 12 *He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge.
\p
\v 13 At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: *he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
\p
\v 14 Every man is become a fool for knowledge, every artist is confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and there is no spirit in them.
\p
\v 15 They are vain things, and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\p
\v 16 The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.
\p
\v 17 Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.
\p
\v 18 For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will cast away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.
\p
\v 19 Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear it.
\p
\v 20 My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\p
\v 21 Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is scattered.
\p
\v 22 Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the north country: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and a dwelling for dragons.
\p
\v 23 I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.
\p
\v 24 Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgement: and not in thy fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.
\p
\v 25 Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his glory.

\cd The prophet proclaims the covenant of God: and denounces evils and to the obstinate transgressors of it. The conspiracy of the Jews against him, a figure of their conspiracy against Christ.
\p
\v 1 The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 2 Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed is the man that shall not hearken to the words of this covenant.
\p
\v 4 Which I commanded your fathers, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying: Hear ye my voice, and do all things that I command you: and you shall be my people, and I will be your God:
\p
\v 5 That I may accomplish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered, and said: Amen, O Lord.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said to me: Proclaim aloud all these words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of the covenant, and do them:
\p
\v 7 For protesting, I conjured your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, even to this day: rising early, I conjured them, and said: Hearken ye to my voice:
\p
\v 8 And they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear: but walked every one in the perverseness of his own wicked heart: and I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.
\p
\v 9 And the Lord said to me: A conspiracy is found among the men of Juda, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 10 They are returned to the former iniquities of their fathers, who refused to hear my words: so these likewise have gone after strange gods, to serve them: the house of Israel, and the house of Juda, have made void my covenant, which I made with their fathers.
\p
\v 11 Wherefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring in evils upon them, which they shall not be able to escape: and they shall cry to me, and I will not hearken to them.
\p
\v 12 And the cities of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer sacrifice, and they shall not save them in the time of their affliction.
\p
\v 13 *For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda: and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem, thou hast set up altars of confusion, altars to offer sacrifice to Baalim.
\p
\v 14 *Therefore do not thou pray for this people, and do not take up praise and prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time of their cry to me, in the time of their affliction.
\p
\v 15 What is the meaning, that my beloved hath wrought much wickedness in my house? shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes, in which thou hast boasted?
\p
\v 16 The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive-tree, fair, fruitful, and beautiful: at the noise of a word, a great fire was kindled in it, and the branches thereof are burnt.
\p
\v 17 And the Lord of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee: for the evils of the house of Israel, and of the house of Juda, which they have done to themselves, to provoke me, offering sacrifice to Baalim.
\p
\v 18 But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known: then thou shewedst me their doings.
\p
\v 19 And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and I knew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying: Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more.
\p
\v 20 *But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and triest the reins and hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to thee have I revealed my cause.
\p
\v 21 Therefore thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life, and say: Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord, and thou shalt not die in our hands.
\p
\v 22 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will visit upon them: and their young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine.
\p
\v 23 And there shall be no remains of them: for I will bring in evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their visitation.

\cd The prosperity of the wicked shall be but for a short time. The desolation of the Jews for their sins. Their return from their captivity.
\p
\v 1 Thou indeed, O Lord, art just, if I plead with thee, *but yet I will speak what is just to thee: **Why doth the way of the wicked prosper: why is it well with all them that transgress, and do wickedly?
\p
\v 2 Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
\p
\v 3 And thou, O Lord, hast known me; thou hast seen me, and proved my heart with thee: gather them together as sheep for a sacrifice, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\p
\v 4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall not see our last end.
\p
\v 5 If thou hast been wearied with running with footmen, how canst thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?
\p
\v 6 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice: believe them not when they speak good things to thee.
\p
\v 7 I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I have given my dear soul into the hand of her enemies.
\p
\v 8 My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood: it hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.
\p
\v 9 Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? is it as a bird dyed throughout? come ye, assemble yourselves, all ye beasts of the earth; make haste to devour.
\p
\v 10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful portion into a desolate wilderness.
\p
\v 11 They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With desolation is all the land made desolate: because there is none that considereth in the heart.
\p
\v 12 The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness, for the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the other end thereof: there is no peace for all flesh.
\p
\v 13 They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they have received an inheritance, and it shall not profit them: you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.
\p
\v 14 Thus saith the Lord, against all my wicked neighbours, that touch the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel: Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the house of Juda out of the midst of them.
\p
\v 15 And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return, and have mercy on them: and I will bring them back every man to his inheritance, and every man into his land.
\p
\v 16 And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The Lord liveth; as they have taught my people to swear by Baal: that they shall be built up in the midst of my people.
\p
\v 17 But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and destroy that nation, saith the Lord.

\cd Under the figure of a linen girdle is foretold the destruction of the Jews. Their obstinacy in sin brings all miseries upon them.
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord to me: Go, and get thee a linen girdle, and thou shalt put it about thy loins, and shalt not put it into water.
\p
\v 2 And I got a girdle according to the word of the Lord, and put it about my loins.
\p
\v 3 And the word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying:
\p
\v 4 Take the girdle which thou hast got, which is about thy loins, and arise, and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
\p
\v 5 And I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had commanded me.
\p
\v 6 And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said to me: Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle, which I commanded thee to hide there.
\p
\v 7 And I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle out of the place where I had hid it: and behold, the girdle was rotten, so that it was fit for no use.
\p
\v 8 And the word of the Lord came to me saying:
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the Lord: After this manner will I make the pride of Juda, and the great pride of Jerusalem to rot.
\p
\v 10 This wicked people, that will not hear my words, and that walk in the perverseness of their heart, and have gone after strange gods to serve them, and to adore them: and they shall be as this girdle, which is fit for no use.
\p
\v 11 For as the girdle sticketh close to the loins of a man, so have I brought close to me all of the house of Israel, and all the house of Juda, saith the Lord: that they might be my people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\p
\v 12 Thou shalt speak therefore to them this word: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Every bottle shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to thee: Do we not know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\p
\v 13 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings of the race of David that sit upon his throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\p
\v 14 And I will scatter them every man from his brother, and fathers and sons in like manner, saith the Lord: I will not spare, and I will not pardon: nor will I have mercy, but destroy them.
\p
\v 15 Hear ye, and give ear: Be not proud, for the Lord hath spoken.
\p
\v 16 Give ye glory to the Lord your God, before it be dark, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains: you shall look for light, and he will turn it into the shadow of death, and into darkness.
\p
\v 17 But if you will not hear this, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride: *weeping it shall weep, and my eyes shall run down the tears, because the flock of the Lord is carried away captive.
\p
\v 18 Say to the king, and to the queen: Humble yourselves, sit down: for the crown of your glory is come down from your head.
\p
\v 19 The cities of the south are shut up, and there is none to open them: all Juda is carried away captive with an entire captivity.
\p
\v 20 Lift up your eyes, and see, you that come from the north: where is the flock that is given thee, thy beautiful cattle?
\p
\v 21 What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee? for thou hast taught them against thee, and instructed them against thy own head: shall not sorrows lay hold on thee, as a woman in labour?
\p
\v 22 And if thou shalt say in thy heart: Why are these things come upon me? *For the greatness of thy iniquity, thy nakedness is discovered, the soles of thy feet are defiled.
\p
\v 23 If the Ethiopian can change his skin, or the leopard his spots: you also may do well, when you have learned evil.
\p
\v 24 And I will scatter them as stubble, which is carried away by the wind in the desert.
\p
\v 25 This is thy lot, and the portion of thy measure from me, saith the Lord, because thou hast forgotten me, and hast trusted in falsehood.
\p
\v 26 Wherefore I have also bared my thighs against thy face, and thy shame hath appeared.
\p

\cd A grievous famine: and the prophet's prayer on that occasion. Evils denounced to false prophets. The prophet mourns for his people.
\p
\v 1 The word of the Lord, that came to Jeremias, concerning the words of the drought.
\p
\v 2 Judea hath mourned, and the gates thereof are fallen, and are become obscure on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
\p
\v 3 The great ones sent their inferiors to the water, they came to draw, they found no water, they carried back their vessels empty: they were confounded and afflicted, and covered their heads.
\p
\v 4 For the destruction of the land, because there came no rain upon the earth, the husbandmen were confounded, they covered their heads.
\p
\v 5 Yea, the hind also brought forth in the field, and left it: because there was no grass.
\p
\v 6 And the wild asses stood upon the rocks, they snuffed up the wind like dragons, their eyes failed, because there was no grass.
\p
\v 7 If our iniquities have testified against us, O Lord, do thou it for thy name's sake, for our rebellions are many, we have sinned against thee.
\p
\v 8 O expectation of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble: why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a way-faring man turning in to lodge?
\p
\v 9 Why wilt thou be as a wandering man, as a mighty man that cannot save? but thou, O Lord, art among us, and thy name is called upon by us, forsake us not.
\p
\v 10 Thus saith the Lord to this people, that have loved to move their feet, and have not rested, and have not pleased the Lord: He will now remember their iniquities, and visit their sins.
\p
\v 11 And the Lord said to me: *Pray not for this people for their good.
\p
\v 12 When they fast I will not hear their prayers; and if they offer holocausts and victims, I will not receive them: for I will consume them by the sword, and by famine, and by the pestilence.
\p
\v 13 And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God: the prophets say to them: *You shall not see the sword, and there shall be no famine among you, but he will give you true peace in this place.
\p
\v 14 And the Lord said to me: *The prophets prophesy falsely in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor have I spoken to them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination and deceit, and the seduction of their own heart.
\p
\v 15 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, concerning the prophets, that prophesy in my name, whom I did not send, that say: Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\p
\v 16 And the people to whom they prophesy, shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine and the sword, and there shall be none to bury them: they and their wives, their sons, and their daughters, and I will pour out their own wickedness upon them.
\p
\v 17 And thou shalt speak this word to them: *Let my eyes shed down tears night and day, and let them not cease because the virgin daughter of my people is afflicted with a great affliction, with an exceedingly grievous evil.
\p
\v 18 If I go forth into the fields, behold the slain with the sword: and if I enter into the city, behold them that are consumed with famine. The prophet also, and the priest, are gone into a land which they knew not.
\p
\v 19 Hast thou utterly cast away Juda, or hath thy soul abhorred Sion? why then hast thou struck us, so that there is no healing for us? *we have looked for peace, and there is no good: and for the time of healing, and behold trouble.
\p
\v 20 We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, the iniquities of our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
\p
\v 21 Give us not to be a reproach, for thy name's sake, and do not disgrace in us the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.
\p
\v 22 Are there any among the graven things of the Gentiles that can send rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou the Lord our God, whom we have looked for? for thou hast made all these things.

\cl Jeremias 15
\cd God is deternined to punish the Jews for their sins. The prophet's complaint, and God's promise to him.
\p
\v 1 And the Lord said to me: If Moses and Samuel shall stand before me, my soul is not towards this people: cast them out from my sight, and let them go forth.
\p
\v 2 And if they shall say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: *Such as are for death, to death: and such as are for the sword, to the sword: and such as are for famine, to famine: and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
\p
\v 3 And I will visit them with four kinds, saith the Lord: The sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
\p
\v 4 And I will give them up to the rage of all the kingdoms of the earth: *because of Manasses, the son of Ezechias, the king of Juda, for all that he did in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 For who shall have pity on thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go to pray for thy peace?
\p
\v 6 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward: and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will destroy thee: I am weary of intreating thee.
\p
\v 7 And I will scatter them with a fan in the gates of the land: I have killed and destroyed my people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.
\p
\v 8 Their widows are multiplied unto me above the sand of the sea: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young man, a spoiler at noon-day: I have cast a terror on a sudden upon the cities.
\p
\v 9 *She that hath borne seven is become weak, her soul hath fainted away: **her sun is gone down, while it was yet day: she is confounded, and ashamed: and the residue of them I will give up to the sword in the sight of their enemies, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 10 Woe is me, my mother: why hast thou borne me a man of strife, a man of contention to all the earth? I have not lent on usury, neither hath any man lent to me on usury, yet all curse me.
\p
\v 11 The Lord saith to me: Assuredly it shall be well with thy remnant, assuredly I shall help thee in the time of affliction, and in the time of tribulation, against the enemy.
\p
\v 12 Shall iron be allied with the iron from the north, and the brass?
\p
\v 13 Thy riches and thy treasures I will give unto spoil for nothing, because of all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
\p
\v 14 And I will bring thy enemies out of a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in my rage, it shall burn upon you.
\p
\v 15 O Lord, thou knowest, remember me, and visit me, and defend me from them that persecute me, do not defend me in thy patience: know that for thy sake I have suffered reproach.
\p
\v 16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was to me a joy and gladness of my heart: for thy name is called upon me, O Lord God of hosts.
\p
\v 17 *I sat not in the assembly of jesters, nor did I make a boast of the presence of thy hand: I sat alone, because thou hast filled me with threats.
\p
\v 18 *Why is my sorrow become perpetual, and my wound desperate, so as to refuse to be healed? it is become to me as the falsehood of deceitful waters that cannot be trusted.
\p
\v 19 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: If thou wilt be converted, I will convert thee, and thou shalt stand before my face: and if thou wilt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall be turned to thee, and thou shalt not be turned to them.
\p
\v 20 And I will make thee to this people as a strong wall of brass: and they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the mighty.

\f + \fr 15:1\ft If. The Geneva Bible reads corruptly, "Though Moses...stood," contrary to Hebrew and Greek. (Worthington) --- And Samuel. These two had shewn a particular love for the people, Exodus xxxii., and 2 Kings xii. (Calmet) --- Ezechiel (xiv. 4.) specifies Noe[Noah], Daniel, and Job, who were eminent for sanctity. Daniel was still alive. Yet God will not grant their request; and he forbids his prophet to pray for those who were resolved not to repent, Jeremias 14:11. (Haydock) --- Their punishment was fixed, and God will not remit it at the request either of the living or of the dead. Hence it is evident, that the dead could and did sometimes make intercession, otherwise they would not here be mentioned. To evade this argument, Protestants in the Geneva Bible, suppose God's "meaning to be, that if there were any man living, moved with so great zeal towards the people as were these two, yet he would not grant their request, for so much as he had determined the contrary." Yet surely Jeremias, Daniel, etc., had a similar zeal; and therefore the text speaks of Moses and Samuel in a state of happiness, where their charity is greater than in this life, as St. Jerome, St. Chrysostom (hom. 1. in 1 Thessalonians) and St. Gregory (Mor. 9:12.) explain it. (Worthington) --- Jeremias had been praying earnestly for the people in the temple. But God answers his request with a severity rarely witnessed in Scripture, ordering him to drive the people out, or to announce that they should be thus treated. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 15:2\ft Death. This Hebrew phrase intimates that some should die by sickness, etc. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 15:3\ft Kinds of persecutors, the sword, etc. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 15:4\ft Rage. Hebrew, "agitation." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "necessities." Protestants, "to be removed into all," etc. (Haydock) This the event verified, Isaias 11:11. --- Manasses. Though he obtained pardon, the people would not imitate his repentance. A dreadful warning for princes! (Calmet) --- "The people generally perish by the fault of their governors." (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 15:5\ft Peace. All will abhor thee. (Calmet) --- "The creatures cannot be so clement as the Creator." (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 15:6\ft Intreating thee. Hebrew, "of being intreated;" (St. Jerome) or, "of repenting," and suspending the effects of my wrath. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "I will no longer spare them." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 15:7\ft Will, or "have scattered" the ten tribes, and many of Juda, before the last siege. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 15:8\ft Man, or "a spoiler of the young man," (Haydock) so that the widow shall also be deprived of her children. Hebrew, "the young spoiler," Nabuchodonosor. He shall not come like a night thief, to attack the metropolis.\f*
\f + \fr 15:9\ft Seven: many. It is not common for a mother to lose so numerous a family; yet such shall be the misfortune of Jewish parents. The synagogues shall decrease. --- Day. Her prosperity shall end on a sudden. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 15:10\ft Strife. Jeremias was under continual persecution, (Menochius) yet ceased not to reprimand the wicked. (Haydock) --- Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit. (Cicero) --- Usury. Such people are exposed to contention. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 15:11\ft Remnant; posterity, (Calmet) or rather possessions, as the prophet never married, Jeremias 16:2. (Haydock) --- God assures him that he shall be protected. (Menochius) --- The Chaldeans treated him with respect, Jeremias 39:2., and 40:1. Sedecias and the people had often recourse to him. Chaldean, "They will come to intreat thee, when the enemy shall straiten them." (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 15:12\ft Iron. Shall the iron (that is, the strength of Juda) stand against the stronger iron of the north, (that is, of Babylon) or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it? No, certainly; but it must be broken by it. (Challoner) --- Iron is not easily united with brass, though Pliny ([Natural History?] 34:4.) mentions a statue of this nature. Neither iron nor brass can stand against steel, which is meant by the iron from the north. The Jews shall not hurt Jeremias, ver. 20., and Jeremias 1:17. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?" The riches of Juda shall become a prey, ver. 13. (Haydock) --- Stronger kingdoms easily oppress their weak allies. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 15:14\ft Bring. Septuagint, "enslave thee to thy," etc. Chaldean, "thou shalt serve." (Haydock) --- They have read (Calmet) hahabadti. Hebrew has r instead of d, "I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a," etc. (Protestants) (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 15:15\ft Patience. That is, let not thy patience and long suffering, which thou usest towards sinners, keep thee from making haste to my assistance. (Challoner) --- He is actuated by a zeal for God's glory. (Calmet) --- He is afraid of his own weakness, and begs to be delivered shortly, Psalm 12:2. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 15:16\ft Eat them. I received them most cordially, (Ezechiel 3:1.; Haydock) as one who is hungry. --- Upon me. I was recognized as the prophet of the Lord.\f*
\f + \fr 15:17\ft Jesters, who deride religion, (Psalm 1:1.) or sport away their time. (Calmet) --- Hand, through vanity. Literally, "and I boast of." (Haydock) --- I rejoiced in suffering, as this prophet. Many (Calmet) supply nor from the former part of the sentence. (Menochius) --- Threats. I could not refrain from admonishing the people of their ways, (Haydock) which I would not countenance by my presence. (Calmet) --- All indeed kept at a distance from me.\f*
\f + \fr 15:18\ft Trusted. It is not cured as soon as might be expected. (Haydock) --- It continually breaks out again, (Menochius) like a bog not properly drained. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "Thou art become," etc. Chaldean, "break not thy promise, as," etc., Do not reject me when I stand most in need of redress. (Calmet) --- My hopes seem (Haydock) vain. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 15:19\ft Converted, and cease to fear the people; (Calmet) and confide in my precious words, (Haydock) despising the vile threats of the people. (Menochius) --- Mouth; interpreter, Exodus 4:16. Chaldean, "If thou wilt recall the wicked into the way of justice, though shalt fulfill my will." See St. Jerome in Psalm 105:32. --- To thee. Thus Sedecias and the people acted, Jeremias 21:1., and 42:2. (Calmet) --- The prophet must not give way to sinners, but they must be reclaimed. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 15:21\ft Mighty; Chaldeans. Providence watched over Jeremias, amid all his enemies. (Calmet)\f*

\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have thee sons, and daughters, in this place.
\p
\v 3 For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and daughters, that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them: and concerning their fathers, of whom they were born in this land:
\p
\v 4 They shall die by the death of grievous illnesses: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be buried, they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed with the sword, and with famine: and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 5 For thus saith the Lord: Enter not into the house of feasting, neither go thou to mourn, nor to comfort them: because I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the Lord, my mercy and commiserations.
\p
\v 6 Both the great and the little shall die in this land: they shall not be buried nor lamented, and men shall not cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.
\p
\v 7 And they shall not break bread among them to him that mourneth, to comfort him for the dead: neither shall they give them to drink of the cup, to comfort them for their father and mother.
\p
\v 8 And do not thou go into the house of feasting, to sit with them, and to eat and drink:
\p
\v 9 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will take away out of this place, in your sight, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
\p
\v 10 And when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and they shall say to thee: *Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced against us all this great evil? what is our iniquity? and what is our sin, that we have sinned against the Lord our God?
\p
\v 11 Thou shalt say to them: Because your fathers forsook me, saith the Lord: and went after strange gods, and served them, and adored them: and they forsook me, and kept not my law.
\p
\v 12 *And you also have done worse than your fathers: for behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken to me.
\p
\v 13 So I will cast you forth out of this land, into a land which you know not, nor your fathers: and there you shall serve strange gods day and night, which shall not give you any rest.
\p
\v 14 Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, when it shall be said no more: The Lord liveth, that brought for the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt:
\p
\v 15 But, The Lord liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of the north, and out of all the lands to which I cast them out: and I will bring them again into their land, which I gave to their fathers.
\p
\v 16 Behold, I will send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them: and after this I will send them many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
\p
\v 17 For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, and their iniquity hath not been hid from my eyes.
\p
\v 18 And I will repay first their double iniquities, and their sins: because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols, and they have filled my inheritance with their abominations.
\p
\v 19 O Lord, my might, and my strength, and my refuge in the day of tribulation: to thee the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth, and shall say: Surely our fathers have possessed lies, a vanity which hath not profited them.
\p
\v 20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?
\p

\cd For their obstinacy in sin the Jews shall be led captive. He is cursed that trusteth in flesh: God alone searcheth the heart, giving to every one as he deserves. The prophet prayeth to be delivered from his enemies: and preacheth up the observance of the sabbath.
\p
\v 1 The sin of Juda is written with a pen of iron, with the point of a diamond, it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of their altars.
\p
\v 2 When their children shall remember their altars, and their groves, and their green trees upon high mountains,
\p
\v 3 Sacrificing in the field: I will give thy strength, and all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin in all thy borders.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt be left stript of thy inheritance, which I gave thee: and I will make thee serve thy enemies in a land which thou knowest not: because thou hast kindled a fire in my wrath, it shall burn for ever.
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord: *Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.
\p
\v 6 *For he shall be like tamaric in the desert, and he shall not see when good shall come: but he shall dwell in dryness in the desert, in a salt land, and not inhabited.
\p
\v 7 Blessed be the man that trusteth in the Lord, and the Lord shall be his confidence.
\p
\v 8 *And he shall be as a tree that is planted by the waters, that spreadeth out its roots towards moisture: and it shall not fear when the heat cometh. And the leaf thereof shall be green, and in the time of drought it shall not be solicitous, neither shall it cease at any time to bring forth fruit.
\p
\v 9 The heart is perverse above all things, and unsearchable, who can know it?
\p
\v 10 I am the Lord *who search the heart, and prove the reins: who give to every one according to his way, and according to the fruit of his devices.
\p
\v 11 As the partridge hath hatched eggs which she did not lay: so is he that hath gathered riches, and not by right: in the midst of his days he shall leave them, and in his latter end he shall be a fool.
\p
\v 12 A high and glorious throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctification:
\p
\v 13 O Lord, the hope of Israel: all that forsake thee, shall be confounded: they that depart from thee, shall be written in the earth: because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.
\p
\v 14 Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.
\p
\v 15 Behold, they say to me: Where is the word of the Lord? let it come.
\p
\v 16 And I am not troubled, following thee for my pastor, and I have not desired the day of man, thou knowest. That which went out of my lips, hath been right in thy sight.
\p
\v 17 Be not thou a terror unto me, thou art my hope in the day of affliction.
\p
\v 18 Let them be confounded that persecute me, and let not me be confounded: let them be afraid, and let not me be afraid: bring upon them the day of affliction, and with a double destruction, destroy them.
\p
\v 19 Thus saith the Lord to me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Juda come in, and go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem:
\p
\v 20 And thou shalt say to them: Hear the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda, and all Juda, and all the inhabitant of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates.
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the Lord: Take heed to your souls, and carry no burdens on the sabbath-day: and bring them not in by the gates of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 22 And do not bring burdens out of your houses on the sabbath-day, neither do ye any work: sanctify the sabbath-day, as I commanded your fathers.
\p
\v 23 But they did not hear, nor inclined their ear: but hardened their neck, that they might not hear me, and might not receive instruction.
\p
\v 24 And it shall come to pass: if you will hearken to me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burdens by the gates of this city on the sabbath-day: and if you will sanctify the sabbath-day, to do no work therein:
\p
\v 25 Then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes, sitting upon the throne of David, and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
\p
\v 26 And they shall come from the cities of Juda, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plains, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing holocausts, and victims, and sacrifices, and frankincense, and they shall bring in an offering into the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 27 But if you will not hearken to me, to sanctify the sabbath-day, and not to carry burdens, and not to bring them in by the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath-day: I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the houses of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

\f + \fr 17:1\ft The. Grabe (de Vit. p. 8.) observes that the four first verses were omitted in the Septuagint by some careless transcriber, long before the days of Origen, who restored them from the Hebrew and the other Greek versions. On such occasions his work was very useful; but the marks being soon neglected, great confusion ensued. (St. Jerome) (Kennicott, Dis. ii.) --- Grabe has restored these verses in his edition. (Haydock) --- Eusebius (Dem. x.) and Theodoret acknowledged them; and Nobilius found the first verse thus expressed in many copies, (Calmet) as it is in Grabe: "The sin of Juda is expressed in writing with a finger nail of adamant, cleaving to the breast of," etc. (Haydock) --- Altars, to appear more conspicuously to the latest times.

\f + \fr 17:6\ft Tamaric. A barren shrub, that grows in the driest parts of the wilderness. (Challoner) --- Harhar denotes some sort (Haydock) of "useless wood." (Symmachus) See Jeremias 48:6., and Isaias 17:2. --- Salt, like the environs of Sodom, the fruits of which were bad.\f*

\f + \fr 17:9\ft Perverse. Septuagint, "deep." --- Unsearchable. Septuagint, "man, who shall know him?" (Haydock) --- God alone can search the heart by his own power. He enables saints to do it by the light of glory, or of prophecy; as Eliseus and St. Peter knew secret transactions. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 17:11\ft Partridge. Hebrew kore, (Haydock) may mean the "coucou." The kra lays many eggs, all of which she does not hatch. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not," etc. (Haydock) --- It is rare that all produce birds; so the unjust do not succeed (Calmet) in the end.

\f + \fr 17:16\ft Troubled. Hebrew, "in haste to be a pastor after thee." Chaldean, "I delay not, at thy command, to announce thy truths to them," Jeremias 1:6. Jeremias was aware of the dangers attending his office, yet not dismayed. --- Day: approbation, (1 Corinthians 4:3.) or advantages of the world. (Calmet) --- Of man. Hebrew also "of the wretched:" anush. I wished rather for the people's welfare, (Haydock) and sought not their ruin. (Chaldean) (Theodoret)\f*
\f + \fr 17:18\ft Let them be confounded, etc. Such expressions as these in the writings of the prophets, are not to be understood as imprecations proceeding from malice or desire of revenge, but as prophetic predictions of evils that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners, and approbations of the ways of the divine justice. (Challoner) --- The prophet has already prevented this objection, ver. 16. (Haydock)\f*

\f + \fr 17:25\ft David. I will observe my covenant, 2 Kings 7:12. --- Horses: in prosperity, (Menochius) provided this law, as well as all the rest, be observed. (Haydock) --- Such temporal rewards were commonly proposed under the law, as spiritual ones are now. (Worthington)\f*

\cl Jeremias 18
\cd As clay in the hand of the potter, so is Israel in God's hand. He pardoneth penitents, and punisheth the obstinate. They conspire against Jeremias, for which he denounceth to them the miseries that hang over them.
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
\p
\v 2 Arise, and go down into the potter's house, and there thou shalt hear my words.
\p
\v 3 And I went down into the potter's house, and behold he was doing a work on the wheel.
\p
\v 4 And the vessel was broken which he was making of clay with his hands: and turning, he made another vessel, as it seemed good in his eyes to make it.
\p
\v 5 Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 6 *Cannot I do with you, as this potter, O house of Israel, saith the Lord? behold as clay is in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.
\p
\v 7 I will suddenly speak against a nation, and against a kingdom, *to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy it.
\p
\v 8 If that nation against which I have spoken, shall repent of their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to them.
\p
\v 9 And I will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom, to build up and plant it.
\p
\v 10 If it shall do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice: I will repent of the good that I have spoken to do unto it.
\p
\v 11 Now, therefore, tell the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: *let every man of you return from his evil way, and make ye your ways and your doings good.
\p
\v 12 And they said: We have no hopes: for we will go after our own thoughts, and we will do every one according to the perverseness of his evil heart.
\p
\v 13 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Ask among the nations: Who hath heard such horrible things, as the virgin of Israel hath done to excess?
\p
\v 14 Shall now the snow of Libanus fail from the rock of the field? or can the cold waters that gush out and run down, be taken away?
\p
\v 15 Because my people have forgotten me, sacrificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to walk by them in a way not trodden:
\p
\v 16 *That their land might be given up to desolation, and to a perpetual hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and wag his head.
\p
\v 17 As a burning wind will I scatter them before the enemy: I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their destruction.
\p
\v 18 And they said: Come, and let us invent devices against Jeremias: for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet: come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us give no heed to all his words.
\p
\v 19 Give heed to me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my adversaries.
\p
\v 20 Shall evil be rendered for good, because they have digged a pit for my soul? Remember that I have stood in thy sight, to speak good for them, and to turn away thy indignation from them.
\p
\v 21 Therefore, deliver up their children to famine, and bring them into the hands of the sword: let their wives be bereaved of children, and widows: and let their husbands be slain by death: let their young men be stabbed with the sword in battle.
\p
\v 22 Let a cry be heard out of their houses: for thou shalt bring the robber upon them suddenly: because they have digged a pit to take me, and have hid snares for my feet.
\p
\v 23 But thou, O Lord, knowest all their counsel against me unto death: forgive not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight: let them be overthrown before thy eyes, in the time of thy wrath do thou destroy them.

\cl Jeremias 19
\cd Under the type of breaking a potter's vessel, the prophet foresheweth the desolation of the Jews for their sins.
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord: Go, and take a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests:
\p
\v 2 And go forth into the valley of the son of Ennom, which is by the entry of the earthen gate: and there thou shalt proclaim the words that I shall tell thee.
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt say: Hear the word of the Lord, O ye kings of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring an affliction upon this place: so that whosoever shall hear it, his ears shall tingle:
\p
\v 4 Because they have forsaken me, and have profaned this place: and have sacrificed therein to strange gods, whom neither they nor their fathers knew, nor the kings of Juda: and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents.
\p
\v 5 And they have built the high places of Baalim, to burn their children with fire for a holocaust to Baalim: which I did not command, nor speak of, neither did it once come into my mind.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Ennom, but the valley of slaughter.
\p
\v 7 And I will defeat the counsel of Juda, and of Jerusalem, in this place: and I will destroy them with the sword in the sight of their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and I will give their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 8 *And I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss, because of all the plagues thereof.
\p
\v 9 And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and with the flesh of their daughters: and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege, and in the distress wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.
\p
\v 10 And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that shall go with thee.
\p
\v 11 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Even so will I break this people, and this city, as the potter's vessel is broken, which cannot be made whole again: and they shall be buried in Topheth, because there is no other place to bury in.
\p
\v 12 Thus will I do to this place, saith the Lord, and to the inhabitants thereof: and I will make this city as Topheth.
\p
\v 13 And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Juda, shall be unclean as the place of Topheth: all the houses, upon whose roofs they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings to strange gods.
\p
\v 14 Then Jeremias came from Topheth, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the house of the Lord, and said to all people:
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring in upon this city, and upon all the cities thereof, all the evils that I have spoken against it: because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.

\cl Jeremias 20
\cd The prophet is persecuted: he denounces captivity to his persecutors, and bemoans himself.
\p
\v 1 Now Phassur, the son of Emmer, the priest, who was appointed chief in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremias prophesying these words.
\p
\v 2 And Phassur struck Jeremias, the prophet, and put him in the stocks, that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 3 And when it was light the next day, Phassur brought Jeremias out of the stocks. And Jeremias said to him: The Lord hath not called thy name Phassur, but fear on every side.
\p
\v 4 For thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will deliver thee up to fear, thee and all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall see it, and I will give all Juda into the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall carry them away to Babylon, and shall strike them with the sword.
\p
\v 5 And I will give all the substance of this city, and all its labour, and every precious thing thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Juda will I give into the hands of their enemies: and they shall pillage them, and take them away, and carry them to Babylon.
\p
\v 6 But thou, Phassur, and all that dwell in thy house, shall go into captivity, and thou shalt go to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there thou shalt be buried, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied a lie.
\p
\v 7 Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I am deceived: thou hast been stronger than I, and thou hast prevailed. I am become a laughing-stock all the day, all scoff at me.
\p
\v 8 For I am speaking now this long time, crying out against iniquity, and I often proclaim devastation: and the word of the Lord is made a reproach to me, and a derision all the day.
\p
\v 9 Then I said: I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name: and there came in my heart as a burning fire, shut up in my bones, and I was wearied, not being able to bear it.
\p
\v 10 For I heard the reproaches of many, and terror on every side: Persecute him, and let us persecute him: from all the men, that were my familiars, and continued at my side: if by any means he may be deceived, and we may prevail against him, and be revenged on him.
\p
\v 11 But the Lord is with me as a strong warrior: therefore, they that persecute me, shall fall, and shall be weak: they shall be greatly confounded, *because they have not understood the everlasting reproach, which never shall be effaced.
\p
\v 12 And thou, O Lord of hosts, *prover of the just, who seest the reins and the heart: let me see, I beseech thee, thy vengeance on them: for to thee I have laid open my cause.
\p
\v 13 Sing ye to the Lord, praise the Lord: because he hath delivered the soul of the poor out of the hand of the wicked.
\p
\v 14 *Cursed be the day, wherein I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me, be blessed.
\p
\v 15 Cursed be the man that brought the tidings to my father, saying: A man-child is born to thee: and made him greatly rejoice.
\p
\v 16 Let that man be as the cities that the Lord hath overthrown, and hath not repented: let him hear a cry in the morning, and howling at noon-tide:
\p
\v 17 Who slew me not from the womb, that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb an everlasting conception.

This name signifies, increase and principality; and therefore is here changed to Magor-Missabib, or "fear on every side," to denote the evils that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word of God. (Challoner) --- Aquila renders Posseur, "a stranger," and St. Jerome, "blackness of visage." (Haydock) --- It may also mean, "one who causes paleness." (Calmet) --- Mogur may signify "fear or distress." Septuagint and Syriac, "an exile." (Haydock) --- He deserved to be thus treated, ver. 6. (Calmet) --- He would be terrified by many enemies. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 20:6\ft Lie. He was therefore a false prophet, and vexed that Jeremias should contradict him. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:7\ft Thou hast deceived, etc. The meaning of the prophet is not to charge God with any untruth; but what he calls deceiving, was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the prophetical commission, the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him. (Challoner) --- Hebrew, "thou hast enticed me," when I declined the office. (Tirinus) --- God never promised that he should suffer no persecution. (Haydock) --- Jeremias might also have supposed that he was to be sent to the Gentiles, Jeremias 1:5. (St. Jerome in chap 25:18.) --- The oriental languages are much more lofty than ours, and express common things in the strongest manner. (Calmet) --- We may perceive the different emotions of fear and joy (Du Hamel) with which the prophet was actuated, like St. Paul, and our Saviour himself. The saints evince the weakness of man and the power of divine grace. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "If thou, Lord, hast deceived me, I am," etc. (Tournemine)\f*
\f + \fr 20:8\ft Day. They keep asking where are these enemies from the north, the plagues? etc. (Calmet) --- He is sorry to see the word of God despised, (Theodoret) and is guilty of a venial pusillanimity, concluding that his words had no good effect. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 20:9\ft And there, or "for," etc. I was grieved continually. (Sanctius) --- I could not however refrain from speaking, Acts 17:16., and 1 Corinthians 9:16., and Job 32:18.\f*
\f + \fr 20:10\ft Side, seeking an opportunity to ruin me, as the Pharisees did our Saviour, Psalm 40:10. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "familiars watched for my halting, saying, peradventure he," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 20:12\ft Let me see, etc. This prayer proceeded not from hatred or ill-will, but zeal of justice. (Challoner) --- He expresses in a human manner a future punishment.\f*
\f + \fr 20:13\ft Sing. God having shewn that his prayer should be heard, he gives thanks, (Calmet) and thus shews that what he is going to say proceeds not from impatience. (Theodoret)\f*
\f + \fr 20:14\ft Cursed, etc. In these and the following words of the prophet, there is a certain figure of speech to express with more energy the greatness of the evils to which his birth had exposed him. (Challoner) --- The wicked would deem the day of his birth cursed, or unlucky. (Menochius) --- Jeremias was now in prison, (Grotius) and people in pain express themselves forcibly, particularly in the East, ver. 7., and Job 3:2. (Calmet) --- Perhaps no man had announced the tidings of his birth, or he might be no longer living to feel the effects of a curse: as the day was certainly irrevocably past. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 20:16\ft Repented, his decree for the ruin of Sodom being fixed. --- Noon. This is more extraordinary than at midnight. Let him always be terrified with dismal sounds. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:17\ft Who. Septuagint, "because he (the Lord.; Du Hamel; Tirinus) slew me not in my mother's womb." (Haydock) --- Syriac, Grotius, etc., explain the Hebrew in the same sense, though it may also agree with the Vulgate, from the womb, or as soon as I was born. O that I had never seen the light! (Calmet) --- He abstracts from the effects of original sin. (Tirinus) --- It is better not to exist than to be in constant misery, Matthew xxvi. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- The prophet bewailed the abuse which was made of God's word, by unbelievers, ver. 8. (Haydock)\f*

\cl Jeremias 21
\cd The prophet's answer to the messengers of Sedecias, when Jerusalem was besieged.
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, when king Sedecias sent unto him Phassur, the son of Melchias, and Sophonias, the son of Maasias, the priest, saying:
\p
\v 2 Enquire of the Lord for us, for Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, maketh war against us: if so be, the Lord will deal with us according to all his wonderful works, that he may depart from us.
\p
\v 3 And Jeremias said to them: Thus shall you say to Sedecias:
\p
\v 4 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans, that besiege you round about the walls: and I will gather them together in the midst of this city.
\p
\v 5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand, and with a strong arm, and in fury, and in indignation, and in great wrath.
\p
\v 6 And I will strike the inhabitants of this city: men and beasts shall die of a great pestilence.
\p
\v 7 And, after this, saith the Lord, I will give Sedecias, the king of Juda, and his servants, and his people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, and the sword, and the famine, into the hand of Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword, and he shall not be moved to pity, nor spare them, nor shew mercy on them.
\p
\v 8 And to this people thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
\p
\v 9 *He that shall abide in this city, shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that shall go out, and flee over to the Chaldeans, that besiege you, shall live, and his life shall be to him as a spoil.
\p
\v 10 For I have set my face against this city, for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\p
\v 11 And to the house of the king of Juda: Hear ye the word of the Lord,
\p
\v 12 O house of David, thus saith the Lord: *Judge ye judgement in the morning, and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the hand of the oppressor: lest my indignation go forth like a fire, and be kindled, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your ways.
\p
\v 13 Behold, I come to thee that dwelleth in a valley, upon a rock, above a plain, saith the Lord: and you say: Who shall strike us? and who shall enter into our houses?
\p
\v 14 But I will visit upon you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the Lord: and I will kindle a fire in the forests thereof: and it shall devour all things round about it.

(St. Jerome) (Piscator) --- Sophonias, the second priest, (chap. 37:3., and 52:24.) of the 24th class, (1 Paralipomenon 24:18.) who was slain at Reblatha.

\cl Jeremias 22
\cd An exhortation both to king and people to return to God. The sentence of God upon Joachaz, Joakim, and Jechonias.
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of Juda, and there thou shalt speak this word.
\p
\v 2 And thou shalt say: Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Juda, that sittest upon the throne of David: thou and thy servants, and thy people, who enter in by these gates.
\p
\v 3 Thus saith the Lord: *Execute judgement and justice, and deliver him that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor: and afflict not the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, nor oppress them unjustly: and shed not innocent blood in this place.
\p
\v 4 For if you will do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in, by the gates of this house, kings of the race of David sitting upon his throne, and riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants, and their people.
\p
\v 5 But if you will not hearken to these words: I swear by myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a desolation.
\p
\v 6 For thus saith the Lord to the house of the king of Juda: Thou art to me Galaad, the head of Libanus: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities not habitable.
\p
\v 7 And I will prepare against thee the destroyer and his weapons: and they shall cut down thy chosen cedars, and shall cast them headlong into the fire.
\p
\v 8 And many nations shall pass by this city: and they shall say every man to his neighbour: *Why hath the Lord done so to this great city?
\p
\v 9 And they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and have adored strange gods, and served them.
\p
\v 10 Weep not for him that is dead, nor bemoan him with your tears: lament him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.
\p
\v 11 For thus saith the Lord to Sellum, the son of Josias, the king of Juda, who reigned instead of his father, who went forth out of this place: He shall return hither no more:
\p
\v 12 But in the place, to which I have removed him, there shall he die, and he shall not see this land any more.
\p
\v 13 Woe to him that buildeth up his house by injustice, and his chambers not in judgement: that will oppress his friend without cause, and will not pay him his wages.
\p
\v 14 Who saith: I will build me a wide house, and large chambers: who openeth to himself windows, and maketh roofs of cedar, and painteth them with vermilion.
\p
\v 15 Shalt thou reign, because thou comparest thyself to the cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and it was then well with him?
\p
\v 16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own good: was it not, therefore, because he knew me, saith the Lord?
\p
\v 17 But thy eyes and thy heart are set upon covetousness, and upon shedding innocent blood, and upon oppression, and running after evil works.
\p
\v 18 Therefore, thus saith the Lord concerning Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda: They shall not mourn for him, Alas! my brother, and alas! sister: they shall not lament for him, Alas! my lord, or, alas! the noble one.
\p
\v 19 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, rotten and cast forth *without the gates of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 20 Go up to Libanus, and cry: and lift up thy voice in Basan, and cry to them that pass by, for all thy lovers are destroyed.
\p
\v 21 I spoke to thee in thy properity: and thou saidst: I will not hear: this hath been thy way from thy youth, because thou hast not heard my voice.
\p
\v 22 The wind shall feed all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: and then shalt thou be confounded, and ashamed of all thy wickedness.
\p
\v 23 Thou that sittest in Libanus, and makest thy nest in the cedars, how hast thou mourned when sorrows came upon thee, as the pains of a woman in labour?
\p
\v 24 As I live, saith the Lord, if Jechonias, the son of Joakim, the king of Juda, were a ring on my right hand, I would pluck him thence.
\p
\v 25 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, and into the hand of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\p
\v 26 And I will send thee, and thy mother that bore thee, into a strange country, in which you were not born, and there you shall die:
\p
\v 27 And they shall not return into the land, whereunto they lift up their mind to return thither.
\p
\v 28 Is this man, Jechonias, an earthen and a broken vessel? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?
\p
\v 29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 30 Thus saith the Lord: Write this man barren, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for there shall not be a man of his seed that shall sit upon the throne of David, and have power any more in Juda.

\f + \fr 22:6\ft Galaad, the head of Libanus. By Galaad, a rich and fruitful country, is here signified the royal palace of the kings of the house of David; by Libanus, a high mountain abounding in cedar-trees, the populous city of Jerusalem. (Challoner) (Worthington) (Theodoret) --- Both mountains are connected. (St. Jerome) (Strabo xvi.) --- Yet the proper Galaad was at some distance, and on the side of Ammon very barren. The palaces had arisen from a miserable state to resemble Libanus. They shall surely be destroyed.

\cd God reproves evil governors; and promises to send good pastors; and Christ himself the prince of the pastors. He inveighs against false prophets preaching without being sent.
\p
\v 1 Woe *to the pastors, that destroy and tear the sheep of my pasture, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 2 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, to the pastors that feed my people: You have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit upon you for the evil of your doings, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 3 And I will gather together the remnant of my flock, out of all the lands into which I have cast them out: and I will make them return to their own fields, and they shall increase and be multiplied.
\p
\v 4 *And I will set up pastors over them, and they shall feed them: they shall fear no more, and they shall not be dismayed: and none shall be wanting of their number, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 5 *Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will raise up to David a just branch: and a king shall reign, and shall be wise: and shall execute judgement and justice in the earth.
\p
\v 6 In those *days shall Juda be saved, and Israel shall dwell confidently: and this is the name that they shall call him: the Lord, our just one.
\p
\v 7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and they shall say no more: The Lord liveth, who brought up the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt:
\p
\v 8 But, *the Lord liveth, who hath brought out, and brought hither the seed of the house of Israel, from the land of the north, and out of all the lands, to which I had cast them forth: and they shall dwell in their own land.
\p
\v 9 To the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my bones tremble: I am become as a drunken man, and as a man full of wine, at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his holy words.
\p
\v 10 Because the land is full of adulterers, because the land hath mourned by reason of cursing, the fields of the desert are dried up: and their course is become evil, and their strength unlike.
\p
\v 11 For the prophet and the priest are defiled: and in my house I have found their wickedness, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 12 Therefore their way shall be as a slippery way in the dark: for they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evils upon them, the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: they prophesied in Baal, and deceived my people Israel.
\p
\v 14 And I have seen the likeness of adulterers, and the way of lying in the peophets of Jerusalem: and they strengthened the hands of the wicked, that no man should return from his evil doings: that are all become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrha.
\p
\v 15 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, to the prophets: *Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and will give them gall to drink: for, from the prophets of Jerusalem, corruption is gone forth into all the land.
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: *Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you, and deceive you: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 They say to them that blaspheme me: The Lord hath said: *You shall have peace: and to every one that walketh in the perverseness of his own heart, they have said: No evil shall come to you.
\p
\v 18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath seen and heard his word? Who hath considered his word and heard it?
\p
\v 19 *Behold the whirlwind of the Lord's indignation shall come forth, and a tempest shall break out and come upon the head of the wicked.
\p
\v 20 The wrath of the Lord shall not return till he execute it, and till he accomplish the thought of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand his counsel.
\p
\v 21 *I did not send prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
\p
\v 22 If they stood in my counsel, and had made my words known to my people, I should have turned them from their evil way and from their wicked doings.
\p
\v 23 Am I, think ye, a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off?
\p
\v 24 Shall a man be hid in secret places, and I not see him, saith the Lord? do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?
\p
\v 25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, and say: I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\p
\v 26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, and that prophesy the delusions of their own heart.
\p
\v 27 Who seek to make my people forget my name through their dreams, which they tell every man to his neighbour: as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.
\p
\v 28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream: and he that hath my word, let him speak my word with truth: what hath the chaff to do with the wheat, saith the Lord?
\p
\v 29 Are not my words as a fire, saith the Lord: and as a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?
\p
\v 30 Therefore behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord: who steal my words every one from his neighbour.
\p
\v 31 Behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord: who use their tongues, and say: The Lord saith it.
\p
\v 32 Behold I am against the prophets that have lying dreams, saith the Lord: and tell them, and cause my people to err by their lying, and by their wonders: when I sent them not, nor commanded them, who have not profited this people at all, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 33 If therefore this people, or the prophet, or the priest, shall ask thee, saying: What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt say to them: You are the burden: for I will cast you away, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 34 And, as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say: The burden of the Lord: I will visit upon that man, and upon his house.
\p
\v 35 Thus shall you say every one to his neighbour, and to his brother: What hath the Lord answered? and what hath the Lord spoken?
\p
\v 36 And the burden of the Lord shall be mentioned no more, for every man's word shall be his burden: for you have perverted the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts, our God.
\p
\v 37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath the Lord answered thee? and what hath the Lord spoken?
\p
\v 38 But if you shall say: The burden of the Lord: therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because you have said this word: The burden of the Lord: and I have sent to you, saying: Say not the burden of the Lord:
\p
\v 39 Therefore, behold I will take you away, carrying you, and will forsake you, and the city which I gave to you, and to your fathers, out of my presence.

\f + \fr 23:4-5\ft Pastors; Zorobabel, etc., as figures of Christ, and of the pastors of his Church. --- No more, as much as formerly. So many expressions must be understood. --- Branch. Septuagint, "orient." --- Reign. Zorobabel was not chief governor, (Calmet) though at the head of his tribe. (Haydock) --- The kingdom of Christ was not of this world, John 18:36. (Calmet) --- He alone imparts justice to others. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 23:6\ft Saved: less disturbed. The world shall be redeemed, Luke 2:14., and Ephesians 2:14. --- Just. Hebrew, "Justice," by whom we are made just. He is the true God, Colossians 2:9, 14. No man could bear this title: and Grotius insidiously attempts to apply it to the Jews, though the Chaldean, etc., clearly speak of the Messias. He [Grotius] must be read with great caution. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "This is his name, which the Lord will call him, Josedech. In the prophets. (9.) My," etc. (Haydock) --- Josedech means "the Lord justice." (Calmet) --- Symmachus, "Lord, justify us."\f*

\f + \fr 23:14\ft Jerusalem. These were far worse, as they pretended to be inspired by God, whereas those of Samaria publicly adhered to Baal; so that the people must have been foolish to have been deceived by them. (Calmet)\f*

\cl Jeremias 24
\cd Under the type of good and bad figs, he foretells the restoration of the Jews that had been carried away captive with Jechonias, and the desolation of those that were left behind.
\p
\v 1 The Lord shewed me: and behold two baskets full of figs, set before the temple of the Lord, after that *Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, had carried away Jechonias, the son of Joakim, the king of Juda, and his chief men, and the craftsmen, and engravers of Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
\p
\v 2 One basket had very good figs, like the figs of the first season: and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, because they were bad.
\p
\v 3 And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said: Figs, the good figs, very good: and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten, because they are bad.
\p
\v 4 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Juda, whom I have sent forth out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for their good.
\p
\v 6 And I will set my eyes upon them to be pacified, and I will bring them again into this land: and I will build them up, and not pull them down: and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
\p
\v 7 And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: *and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: because they shall return to me with their whole heart.
\p
\v 8 *And as the very bad figs, that cannot be eaten, because they are bad: thus saith the Lord: So will I give Sedecias, the king of Juda, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that have remained in this city, and that dwell in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 9 And I will deliver them up to vexation, and affliction, to all the kingdoms of the earth: to be a reproach, and a bye-word, and a proverb, and to be a curse in all places to which I have cast them out.
\p
\v 10 And I will send among them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: till they be consumed out of the land which I gave to them, and their fathers.

\cl Jeremias 25
\cd The prophet foretells the seventy years captivity: and, after that, the destruction of Babylon, and other nations.
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremias concerning all the people of Juda, in the *fourth year of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda, (the same is the first year of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon.)
\p
\v 2 Which Jeremias, the prophet, spoke to all the people of Juda, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
\p
\v 3 From the thirteenth year of Josias, the son of Ammon, king of Juda, until this day: this is the three and twentieth year, the word of the Lord hath come to me, and I have spoken to you rising before day, and speaking, and you have not hearkened.
\p
\v 4 And the Lord hath sent to you all his servants, the prophets, rising early, and sending, and you have not hearkened, nor inclined your ears to hear.
\p
\v 5 When he said: *Return ye, every one, from his evil way, and from your wicked devices, and you shall dwell in the land which the Lord hath given to you, and to your fathers, for ever and ever.
\p
\v 6 And go not after strange gods to serve them, and adore them: nor provoke me to wrath by the works of your hands, and I will not afflict you.
\p
\v 7 And you have not heard me, saith the Lord, that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.
\p
\v 8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts: Because you have not heard my words:
\p
\v 9 Behold, I will send and take all the kindreds of the north, saith the Lord, and Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, my servant: and I will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all the nations that are round about it: and I will destroy them, and make them an astonishment and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
\p
\v 10 And I will take away from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mill, and the light of the lamp.
\p
\v 11 *And all this land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment: and all these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
\p
\v 12 And when the seventy years shall be expired, I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans: and I will make it perpetual desolations.
\p
\v 13 And I will bring upon the land all my words, that I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book, all that Jeremias hath prophesied against all nations:
\p
\v 14 For they have served them, whereas they were many nations, and great kings: and I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their hands.
\p
\v 15 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take the cup of wine of this fury at my hand: and thou shalt make all nations to drink thereof, unto which I shall send thee.
\p
\v 16 And they shall drink, and be troubled, and be mad because of the sword, which I shall send among them.
\p
\v 17 And I took the cup at the hand of the Lord, and I presented it to all the nations to drink of it, to which the Lord sent me:
\p
\v 18 To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof: to make them a desolation, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse, as it is at this day.
\p
\v 19 Pharao, the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people,
\p
\v 20 And all in general: all the kings of the land of Ausitis, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ascalon, and Gaza, and Accaron, and the remnant of Azotus.
\p
\v 21 And Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 22 And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon: and the kings of the land of the islands that are beyond the sea.
\p
\v 23 And Dedan, and Thema, and Buz, and all that have their hair cut round.
\p
\v 24 And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the west, that dwell in the desert.
\p
\v 25 And all the kings of Zambri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Medes:
\p
\v 26 And all the kings of the north, far and near, every one against his brother: and all the kingdoms of the earth, which are upon the face thereof: and the king of Sesac shall drink after them.
\p
\v 27 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit: and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword, which I shall send among you.
\p
\v 28 And if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Drinking you shall drink:
\p
\v 29 *For behold I begin to bring evil on the city wherein my name is called upon, and shall you be as innocent, and escape free? you shall not escape free: for I will call for the sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 30 And thou shalt prophesy unto them all these words, and thou shalt say to them: *The Lord shall roar from on high, and shall utter his voice from his holy habitation: roaring he shall roar upon the place of his beauty: the shout as it were of them that tread grapes shall be given out against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\p
\v 31 The noise is come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord entereth into judgement with the nations: he entereth into judgement with all flesh; the wicked I have delivered up to the sword, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 32 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation: and a great whirlwind shall go forth from the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 33 And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end thereof: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be gathered up, nor buried: they shall lie as dung upon the face of the earth.
\p
\v 34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry: and sprinkle yourselves with ashes, ye leaders of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and your dispersion are accomplished, and you shall fall like precious vessels.
\p
\v 35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the leaders of the flock to save themselves.
\p
\v 36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the principal of the flock: because the Lord hath wasted their pastures.
\p
\v 37 And the fields of peace have been silent, because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
\p
\v 38 He has forsaken his covert as the lion, for their land is laid waste because of the wrath of the dove, and because of the fierce anger of the Lord.

(Usher) --- This system is not without difficulties. The present prediction seems rather to refer to the desolation, (Vatable; Aggeus 1:2.) as appears from Zacharias 1:12., or the prophet speaks of the same event in both places, dating from the year preceding the capture of Jerusalem, (the year 3415), till Darius gave entire liberty to the Jews, the year 3485.

But the Hebrew word Jonah, which is here rendered a dove, may also signify a waster or oppressor, which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince; or by comparison, as a dove's flight is the swiftest, so would their destruction come upon them. (Challoner) --- Septuagint, "waste or impassible before the great sword,["] chap 4:7. (Haydock) --- While God, like a lion, protected his people, none durst invade them. (Menochius) --- What is said respecting the Babylonian standards is very dubious, (Grotius; Calmet) as the same expression is applied to the Persians, (chap. 50:16.; Menochius) though it may there also be understood of the Chaldeans.

\cd The prophet is apprehended and accused by the priests: but discharged by the princes.
\p
\v 1 In *the beginning of the reign of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda, came this word from the Lord, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord: Stand in the court of the house of the Lord, and speak to all the cities of Juda, out of which they come, to adore in the house of the Lord, all the words which I have commanded thee to speak unto them: leave not out one word.
\p
\v 3 If so be they will hearken, and be converted every one from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil that I think to do unto them for the wickedness of their doings.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If you will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have given to you,
\p
\v 5 To give ear to the words of my servants, the prophets, whom I sent to you rising up early, and sending, and you have not hearkened:
\p
\v 6 *I will make this house like Silo: **and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\p
\v 7 And the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 8 And when Jeremias made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people: the priests, and the prophets, and all the people laid hold of him, saying: Let him be put to death.
\p
\v 9 Why hath he prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying: This house shall be like Silo: and this city shall be made desolate, without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered together against Jeremias, in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 10 And the princes of Juda heard these words: and they went up from the king's house into the house of the Lord, and sat in the entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 11 And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying: The judgement of death is for this man: because he hath prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.
\p
\v 12 Then Jeremias spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying: *The Lord sent me to prophesy concerning this house, and concerning this city, all the words you have heard.
\p
\v 13 *Now, therefore, amend your ways, and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God: and the Lord will repent of the evil that he hath spoken against you.
\p
\v 14 But, as for me, behold I am in your hands: do with me what is good and right in your eyes:
\p
\v 15 But know ye, and understand, that if you put me to death, you will shed innocent blood against your ownselves, and against this city, and the inhabitants thereof. For, in truth, the Lord sent me to you, to speak all these words in your hearing.
\p
\v 16 Then the princes, and all the people said to the priests, and to the prophets: There is no judgement of death for this man: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.
\p
\v 17 And some of the ancients of the land rose up: and they spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:
\p
\v 18 Micheas, of Morasthi, was a prophet, in the days of Ezechias, king of Juda, and he spoke to all the people of Juda, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: *Sion shall be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall be a heap of stones: and the mountain of the house the high places of woods.
\p
\v 19 Did Ezechias, king of Juda, and all Juda, condemn him to death? did they not fear the Lord, and beseech the face of the Lord: and the Lord repented of the evil that they had spoken against them? therefore, we are doing a great evil against our souls.
\p
\v 20 There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urias, the son of Semei, of Cariathiarim, and he prophesied against this city, and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremias.
\p
\v 21 And king Joakim, and all his men in power, and his princes, heard these words: and the king sought to put him to death. And Urias heard it, and was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt.
\p
\v 22 And king Joakim sent men into Egypt, Elnathan, the son of Achobor, and men with him into Egypt.
\p
\v 23 And they brought Urias out of Egypt: and brought him to king Joakim, and he slew him with the sword: and he cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
\p
\v 24 So the hand of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, was with Jeremias, that he should not be delivered into the hands of the people, to put him to death.

\cl Jeremias 27
\cd The prophet sends chains to divers kings, signifying that they must bend their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon. The vessels of their temple shall not be brought back till all the rest are carried away.
\p
\v 1 In *the beginning of the reign of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda, this word came to Jeremias, from the Lord, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord, to me: Make thee bands, and chains: and thou shalt put them on thy neck.
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon: by the hand of the messengers that are come to Jerusalem, to Sedecias, the king of Juda.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt command them to speak to their masters: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to your masters:
\p
\v 5 I made the earth, and the men, and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power, and by my stretched out arm: and I have given it to whom it seemed good in my eyes.
\p
\v 6 And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, my servant: moreover also the beasts of the field I have given him to serve him.
\p
\v 7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son: till the time come for his land and himself: and many nations and great kings shall serve him.
\p
\v 8 But the nation and kingdom that will not serve Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, and whosoever will not bend his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon: I will visit upon that nation with the sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, saith the Lord: till I consume them by his hand.
\p
\v 9 *Therefore, hearken not to your prophets and diviners, and dreamers, and soothsayers, and sorcerers, that say to you: You shall not serve the king Babylon.
\p
\v 10 For they prophesy lies to you: to remove you far from your country, and cast you out, and to make you perish.
\p
\v 11 But the nation that shall bend down their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and shall serve him: I will let them remain in their own land, saith the Lord: and they shall till it, and dwell in it.
\p
\v 12 And I spoke to Sedecias, the king of Juda, according to all these words, saying: Bend down your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, and his people, and you shall live.
\p
\v 13 Why will you die, thou and thy people by the sword, and by famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoke against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
\p
\v 14 Hearken not to the words of the prophets, that say to you: You shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they tell you a lie.
\p
\v 15 *For I have not sent them, saith the Lord: and they prophesy in my name falsely: to drive you out, and that you may perish, both you and the prophets, that prophesy to you.
\p
\v 16 I spoke also to the priests, and to this people, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Hearken not to the words of your prophets, that prophesy to you, saying: Behold, the vessels of the Lord shall now in a short time be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
\p
\v 17 Therefore, hearken not to them, but serve the king of Babylon, that you may live. Why should this city be given up to desolation?
\p
\v 18 But if they be prophets, and the word of the Lord be in them: let them interpose themselves before the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which were left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Juda, and in Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.
\p
\v 19 For thus saith the Lord of hosts *to the pillars, and to the sea, and to the bases, and to the rest of the vessels that remain in this city:
\p
\v 20 Which Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, did not take, when he carried away Jechonias, the son of Joakim, the king of Juda, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the great men of Juda and Jerusalem.
\p
\v 21 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Juda and Jerusalem:
\p
\v 22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day of their visitation, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to be brought, and to be restored in this place.

\cl Jeremias 28
\cd The false prophecy of Hananias: he dies that same year as Jeremias foretold.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in that year, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias, king of Juda, in the fourth year, *in the fifth month, that Hananias, the son of Azur, a prophet, of Gabaon, spoke to me, in the house of the Lord, before the priests, and all the people, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 3 As yet, two years of days, and I will cause all the vessels of the house of the Lord to be brought back into this place, which Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon.
\p
\v 4 And I will bring back to this place, Jechonias, the son of Joakim, king of Juda, and all the captives of Juda, that are gone to Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 5 And Jeremias, the prophet, said to Hananias, the prophet, in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord:
\p
\v 6 And Jeremias, the prophet, said: Amen, the Lord do so: the Lord perform thy words, which thou hast prophesied: that the vessels may be brought again into the house of the Lord, and all the captives may return out of Babylon to this place.
\p
\v 7 Nevertheless, hear this word, that I speak in thy ears, and in the ears of all the people:
\p
\v 8 The prophets that have been before me, and before thee from the beginning, and have prophesied concerning many countries, and concerning great kingdoms, of war, and of affliction, and of famine.
\p
\v 9 The prophet that prophesied peace: when his word shall come to pass, the prophet shall be known, whom the Lord hath sent in truth.
\p
\v 10 And Hananias, the prophet, took the chain from the neck of Jeremias, the prophet, and broke it.
\p
\v 11 And Hananias spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, after two full years, from off the neck of all the nations.
\p
\v 12 And Jeremias, the prophet, went his way. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Hananias, the prophet, had broken the chain from off the neck of Jeremias, the prophet, saying:
\p
\v 13 Go, and tell Hananias: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast broken chains of wood, and thou shalt make for them chains of iron.
\p
\v 14 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, to serve Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, and they shall serve him: moreover also I have given him the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 15 And Jeremias, the prophet, said to Hananias, the prophet: Hear now, Hananias: the Lord hath not sent thee, and thou hast made this people to trust in a lie.
\p
\v 16 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Behold I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year shalt thou die: for thou hast spoken against the Lord.
\p
\v 17 And Hananias, the prophet, died in that year, in the seventh month.
\f + \fr 28:1\ft Year of the World 3408, Year before Christ 596.\f*
\f + \fr 28:1\ft Juda. So far Sanctius joins with the former chapter, improperly. In the 4th year, seems rather an interpolation; though the Septuagint omit in the beginning, etc., to reconcile the passage; and others date the 4th year from the last sabbatical one, which is quite unusual. See Jeremias 27:1. (Calmet) --- Sedecias reigned 11 years, so that the 4th might be said to be the beginning. (Worthington) --- Prophet. Septuagint, "false prophet," to explain the meaning: the original denotes any prophet. (St. Jerome) (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 28:3\ft Years. Some were brought back in the 4th of Sedecias; (chap. 27:16.; Haydock) so that this must be false, whether he spoke in the 1st or 4th year of his reign. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 28:6\ft Do. Hebrew also, "will do." He speaks ironically; or shews that he wishes not the misfortune of his countrymen. (Calmet) --- He approves of the good thing, but warns his people that it is falsely promised. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 28:9\ft Truth. This criterion was given by Moses; and another was assigned in case the prophet attempted to introduce idolatry, which was not here the case, Deuteronomy xiii., and 18:20. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 28:10\ft Chain, or wooden yoke, Jeremias 27:2. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 28:12\ft Way, mildly. God inspired him what to say soon after.\f*

\cl Jeremias 29
\cd Jeremias writeth to the captives in Babylon, exhorting them to be easy there, and not to hearken to false prophets. That they shall be delivered after seventy years. But those that remain in Jerusalem shall perish by the sword, famine, and pestilence. And that Achab, Sedecias, and Semeias, false prophets, shall die miserably.
\p
\v 1 Now *these are the words of the letter which Jeremias, the prophet, sent from Jerusalem, to the residue of the ancients that were carried into captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\p
\v 2 After that Jechonias, the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, and the princes of Juda, and of Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the engravers, were departed out of Jerusalem :
\p
\v 3 By the hand of Elasa, the son of Saphan, and Gamarias, the son of Helcias, whom Sedecias, king of Juda, sent to Babylon, to Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, saying:
\p
\v 4 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\p
\v 5 Build ye houses, and dwell in them: and plant orchards, and eat the fruit of them.
\p
\v 6 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters: and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and let them bear sons and daughters: and be ye multiplied there, and be not few in number.
\p
\v 7 And seek the peace of the city, to which I have caused you to be carried away captives; and pray to the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof shall be your peace.
\p
\v 8 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: *Let not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you: and give no heed to your dreams which you dream:
\p
\v 9 For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: and I have not sent them, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 10 *For thus saith the Lord: When the seventy years shall begin to be accomplished in Babylon, I will visit you: and I will perform my good word in your favour, to bring you again to this place.
\p
\v 11 For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of affliction, to give you an end and patience.
\p
\v 12 And you shall call upon me, and you shall go: and you shall pray to me, and I will hear you.
\p
\v 13 You shall seek me, and shall find me: when you shall seek me with all your heart.
\p
\v 14 And I will be found by you, saith the Lord: and I will bring back your captivity, and I will gather you out of all nations, and from all the places to which I have driven you out, saith the Lord: and I will bring you back from the place to which I caused you to be carried away captive.
\p
\v 15 Because you have said: The Lord hath raised us up prophets in Babylon:
\p
\v 16 For thus saith the Lord to the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and to all the people that dwell in this city, to your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity.
\p
\v 17 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: *Behold, I will send upon them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and I will make them like bad figs that cannot be eaten, because they are very bad.
\p
\v 18 And I will persecute them with the sword, and with famine, and with the pestilence: and I will give them up unto affliction to all the kingdoms of the earth: to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach to all the nations to which I have driven them out:
\p
\v 19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord: which I sent to them by my servants, the prophets, rising by night, and sending: and you have not heard, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 20 Hear ye, therefore, the word of the Lord, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent out from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to Achab, the son of Colias, and to Sedecias, the son of Maasias, who prophesy unto you in my name, falsely: Behold I will deliver them up into the hands of Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon: and he shall kill them before your eyes.
\p
\v 22 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Juda, that are in Babylon, saying: The Lord make thee like Sedecias, and like Achab, whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire:
\p
\v 23 Because they have acted folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with the wives of their friends, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I commanded them not: I am the judge, and the witness, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 24 And to Semeias, the Nehelamite, thou shalt say:
\p
\v 25 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are in Jerusalem, and to Sophonias, the son of Maasias, the priest, and to all the priests, saying:
\p
\v 26 The Lord hath made thee priest in stead of Joiada, the priest, that thou shouldst be ruler in the house of the Lord, over every man that raveth and prophesieth, to put him in the stocks, and into prison.
\p
\v 27 And now why hast thou not rebuked Jeremias, the Anathothite, who prophesieth to you?
\p
\v 28 For he hath also sent to us, in Babylon, saying: It is a long time: Build ye houses, and dwell in them: and plant gardens, and eat the fruits of them.
\p
\v 29 So Sophonias, the priest, read this letter, in the hearing of Jeremias, the prophet.
\p
\v 30 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 31 Send to all them of the captivity, saying: Thus saith the Lord to Semeias, the Nehelamite: Because Semeias hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not: and hath caused you to trust in a lie:
\p
\v 32 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will visit upon Semeias, the Nehelamite, and upon his seed: he shall not have a man to sit in the midst of this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, saith the Lord: because he hath spoken treason against the Lord.

\v 1 This *is the word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: Write thee all the words that I have spoken to thee, in a book.
\p
\v 3 For behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Juda, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to return to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
\p
\v 4 And these are the words that the Lord hath spoken to Israel and to Juda:
\p
\v 5 For thus saith the Lord: We have heard a voice of terror: there is fear, and no peace.
\p
\v 6 Ask ye, and see if a man bear children ? why then have I seen every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labour, and all faces are turned yellow?
\p
\v 7 *Alas, for that day is great, neither is there the like to it: and it is the time of tribulation to Jacob, but he shall be saved out of it.
\p
\v 8 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst his bands: and strangers shall no more rule over him:
\p
\v 9 But they shall serve the Lord, their God, and David, their king, whom I will raise up to them.
\p
\v 10 *Therefore, fear thou not, my servant Jacob, saith the Lord, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from a country afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity: and Jacob shall return, and be at rest, and abound with all good things, and there shall be none whom he may fear:
\p
\v 11 For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee: for I will utterly consume all the nations among which I have scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayst not seem to thyself innocent.
\p
\v 12 For thus saith the Lord: Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is very grievous.
\p
\v 13 There is none to judge thy judgment to bind it up : thou hast no healing medicines.
\p
\v 14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee, and will not seek after thee: *for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with a cruel chastisement: by reason of the multitude of thy iniquities, thy sins are hardened.
\p
\v 15 Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow is incurable: for the multitude of thy iniquity, and for thy hardened sins, I have done these things to thee.
\p
\v 16 Therefore, all they that devour thee, shall be devoured: and all thy enemies shall be carried into captivity: and they that waste thee shall be wasted; and all that prey upon thee, will I give for a prey.
\p
\v 17 For I will close up thy scar, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord. Because they have called thee, O Sion, an outcast: This is she that had none to seek after her.
\p
\v 18 Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I bring back the captivity of the pavilions of Jacob, and will have pity on his houses, and the city shall be built in her place, and the temple shall be found according to the order thereof.
\p
\v 19 And out of them shall come forth praise, and the voice of them that play: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be made few: and I will glorify them, and they shall not be lessened.
\p
\v 20 And their children shall be as from the beginning, and their assembly shall be permanent before me: and I will visit against all that afflict them.
\p
\v 21 And their leader shall be of themselves: and their prince shall come forth from the midst of them: and I will bring him near, and he shall come to me: for who is this that setteth his heart to approach to me, saith the Lord?
\p
\v 22 And you shall be my people: and I will be your God.
\p
\v 23 Behold the whirlwind of the Lord, his fury going forth, a violent storm, it shall rest upon the head of the wicked.
\p
\v 24 The Lord will not turn away the wrath of his indignation, till he hath executed and performed the thought of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand these things.

\cd The restoration of Israel. Rachel shall cease from mourning. The new covenant. The Church shall never fail.
\p
\v 1 At that time, *saith the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord: The people that were left and escaped from the sword, found grace in the desert: Israel shall go to his rest.
\p
\v 3 The Lord hath appeared from afar to me. Yea, I have loved thee with everlasting love: therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee.
\p
\v 4 And I will build thee again, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
\p
\v 5 Thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and they shall not gather the vintage before the time:
\p
\v 6 For there shall be a day, in which the watchmen on Mount Ephraim, shall cry: *Arise, and let us go up to Sion, to the Lord our God.
\p
\v 7 For thus saith the Lord: Rejoice ye in the joy of Jacob, and neigh before the head of the Gentiles: shout ye, and sing, and say: Save, O Lord, thy people, the remnant of Israel.
\p
\v 8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and will gather them from the ends of the earth: and among them shall be the blind and the lame, the woman with child, and she that is bringing forth together, a great company of them returning hither.
\p
\v 9 They shall come with weeping: and I will bring them back in mercy: and I will bring them through the torrents of waters in a right way, and they shall not stumble in it: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
\p
\v 10 Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the islands that are afar off, and say: He that scattered Israel will gather him: and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his flock.
\p
\v 11 For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and delivered him out of the hand of one that was mightier than he.
\p
\v 12 And they shall come, and shall give praise in Mount Sion: and they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord, for the corn, and wine, and oil, and the increase of cattle and herds, and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall be hungry no more.
\p
\v 13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, the young men and old men together: and I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them joyful after their sorrow.
\p
\v 14 And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: and my people shall be filled with my good things, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord: *A voice was heard on high of lamentation, of mourning, and weeping of Rachel, weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted for them, because they are not.
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the Lord: Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thy eyes from tears: for there is a reward for thy work, saith the Lord: and they shall return out of the land of the enemy.
\p
\v 17 And here is hope for thy last end, saith the Lord: and the children shall return to their own borders.
\p
\v 18 Hearing, I heard Ephraim, when he went into captivity: thou hast chastised me, and I was instructed as a young bullock unaccustomed to the yoke. Convert me, and I shall be converted: for thou art the Lord my God.
\p
\v 19 For, after thou didst convert me, I did penance: and, after thou didst shew unto me, I struck my thigh: I am confounded and ashamed, because I have borne the reproach of my youth.
\p
\v 20 Surely Ephraim is an honourable son to me, surely he is a tender child: for, since I spoke of him, I will still remember him. Therefore are my bowels troubled for him: pitying, I will pity him, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 21 Set thee up a watch-tower, make to thee bitterness: direct thy heart into the right way, wherein thou hast walked: return, O virgin of Israel, return to these thy cities.
\p
\v 22 How long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness, O wandering daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth: a woman shall compass a man.
\p
\v 23 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As yet shall they say this word in the land of Juda, and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring back their captivity: The Lord bless thee, the beauty of justice, the holy mountain.
\p
\v 24 And Juda and all his cities shall dwell therein together: the husbandmen, and they that drive the flocks.
\p
\v 25 For I have inebriated the weary soul: and I have filled every hungry soul.
\p
\v 26 Upon this I was as it were awaked out of a sleep, and I saw, and my sleep was sweet to me.
\p
\v 27 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord: and I will sow the house of Israel, and the house of Juda, with the seed of men, and with the seed of beasts.
\p
\v 28 And, as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to throw down, and to scatter, and destroy, and afflict; so will I watch over them, to build up, and to plant them, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 29 In those days they shall say no more: *The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the children are set on edge.
\p
\v 30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man that shall eat the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\p
\v 31 *Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Juda:
\p
\v 32 Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; the covenant which they made void, and I had dominion over them, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord: *I will give my law in their bowels, and I will write it in their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
\p
\v 34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest, saith the Lord: *for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
\p
\v 35 Thus saith the Lord, who giveth the sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and of the stars, for the light of the night; who stirreth up the sea, and the waves thereof roar, the Lord of hosts is his name.
\p
\v 36 If these ordinances shall fail before me, saith the Lord; then also the seed of Israel shall fail, so as not to be a nation before me for ever.
\p
\v 37 Thus saith the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath; I also will cast away all the seed of Israel, for all that they have done, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 38 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be built to the Lord, from the tower of Hanameel, even to the gate of the corner.
\p
\v 39 And the measuring line shall go out farther in his sight upon the hill Gareb; and it shall compass Goatha,
\p
\v 40 And the whole valley of dead bodies, and of ashes, and all the country of death, even to the torrent Cedron, and the corner of the horse-gate towards the east, the Holy of the Lord: it shall not be plucked up, and it shall not be destroyed any more for ever.

Benjamin was her son, and was conducted by this road to Babylon. (Chaldean) (Grotius) (Tirinus) --- Ephraim and Manasses were also her grandchildren, and she may bewail their captivity by personification. St. Matthew 2:18. shews that this prediction was more fully accomplished when the innocents were slain. The same passage may allude to different events. (Calmet) --- All the people of God, both of the ten and of the two tribes, bewailed their captivity, and the mothers lamented for those slain near Bethlehem. (Worthington)\f*

(Tirinus) --- The fathers generally explain this of the incarnation. (Calmet) --- Christ had the perfect use of reason in the virgin's womb. (Haydock) --- He was the brightness of his Father's glory, Hebrew 1:3. Even some ancient Jews apply this to the Messias. (Galatin. 7:14.) But the moderns understand that women would offer themselves in marriage; the times would be so happy. This was not so unusual in countries where polygamy prevailed, Ruth 3:9., Isaias 4:1., and Canticle of Canticles 8:1. (Calmet) --- Hence this is hardly the meaning; for God promises something new. (Haydock) --- "The Lord hath created a new thing in a woman." (Aquila) --- Symmachus agrees nearly with the Septuagint, "because the Lord has created thee by salvation a new plantation. Men shall go about in thy salvation." This "might be explained, if it were not sacrilegious to argue respecting God's word by human sense," says St. Jerome; though this censure of "the Vulgate" (Septuagint) seems rather harsh. He complains here of his copy. Theodoret explains it of the apostles going through the world to spread the gospel. (Haydock) --- Behold whence thy happiness must come, (Menochius) O thou who hast so long proved faithless, going astray after many lovers. (Haydock) --- Christ, in his mother's womb, was in stature small, but a perfect man (Worthington) in the use of reason, etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 31:23\ft Bless thee. Thus the captives speak in rapture at their return.\f*
\f + \fr 31:24\ft Together. Jerusalem shall be large enough to contain all, at the great festivals.\f*
\f + \fr 31:26\ft To me. Thus Jeremias concludes his prediction with joy. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 31:27\ft Men. They shall increase exceedingly by my blessing. (Haydock) --- Beasts were the source of their riches. Hence pecunia is derived from pecus. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 31:29\ft Edge. Such observations had been too often made, Ezechiel 18:12. (Haydock) --- Henceforward you shall not suffer for the faults of Achab, Manasses, etc. Each one shall bear his own burden. The captivity has been like a deluge, cleaning all away. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 31:31\ft Covenant. That made with the captives was not such. Their covenant is grown old, and at an end, as St. Paul shews, Hebrews 8:8. They were not indeed divided, as they had been, Ezechiel 37:16.\f*
\f + \fr 31:32\ft Dominion. As a husband, (Hebrew; Calmet) or "Lord." (Haydock) --- "I despised them." (Septuagint) (Hebrews viii.)\f*
\f + \fr 31:33\ft Heart. They were more docile after their return: yet still their service was very imperfect and forced. How many false traditions were received, at the coming of Christ! This of course, regards his disciples.\f*
\f + \fr 31:34\ft Lord. Christ himself came to instruct mankind. The true God was better known than ever, even by the illiterate. Yet God requires us to have recourse to men, in order to know his truths, as St. Paul was sent to Hananias, and the eunuch to Philip. [Acts viii., and ix.] (Haydock) --- The apostles were enlightened by the Holy Ghost, (John 6:45.; St. Augustine, de Spir.; Calmet) who still guides the flock by his pastors. The private spirit is too fanatical and delusive. (Haydock) --- The most ignorant shall easily become acquainted with the truths of salvation. External preaching is requisite, though of little use unless grace touch the mind and the heart. (Tirinus) --- All will hear successively, (Haydock) or embrace the gospel at the same time, for several years before the last day. (Houbigant, pref. in Prop. 356) (Isaias 11:9., and 45:23., and Sophonias 3:9., etc.) (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 31:36\ft Ever. Like the Chanaanites and Ephraim during the captivity, Isaias 7:8. God restored the latter. Yet they are again dispersed from above 17 centuries, so that this perpetuity, which shall equal the world's duration, belongs to the Church. (Calmet) --- Israel remains, not in the incredulous Jews, but in those who with the apostles embraced and propagated the faith of Christ. (St. Jerome) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 31:37\ft Out, experimentally, and not by philosophical hypotheses, which were little known in the days of Jeremias. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "if it be made lower." (Haydock) --- This is impossible; so it is that I should abandon Israel. (Theodoret) --- All was not faithless. (Calmet) --- The Israel of God embraced the gospel. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 31:38\ft Come, is only in the margin of the Hebrew, but is found properly in some manuscripts. (Kennicott) --- Corner. On the south, opposite to the former, 2 Esdras 3:1.\f*
\f + \fr 31:40\ft Valley of Hinnom, or Topheth, (chap. 7:32., and 19:6.) where Cedron flowed, Zacharias 14:4. (Calmet) --- The city was much enlarged on this side, under the Machabees. (Josephus, Jewish Wars 6:6.) --- Ever. Yet the temple was utterly destroyed by the Romans, so that we must explain this of the Catholic Church, founded on a rock, and proof against the gates of hell, and all the malice of heretics and persecutors, Matthew 16:18.

\cl Jeremias 32
\cd Jeremias, by God's commandment, purchases a field of his kinsman: and prophesies the return of the people out of captivity: and the everlasting covenant God will make with his Church.
\p
\v 1 The *word that came to Jeremias, from the Lord, in the tenth year of Sedecias, king of Juda; the same is the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor.
\p
\v 2 At that time the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem; and Jeremias, the prophet, was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the house of the king of Juda.
\p
\v 3 For Sedecias, king of Juda, had shut him up, saying: Why dost thou prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it?
\p
\v 4 And Sedecias, king of Juda, shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans; but he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon; and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes.
\p
\v 5 And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon; and he shall be there till I visit him, saith the Lord. But if you will fight against the Chaldeans, you shall have no success.
\p
\v 6 And Jeremias said: The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 7 Behold, Hanameel, the son of Sellem, thy cousin, shall come to thee, saying: Buy thee my field, which is in Anathoth, for it is thy right to buy it, being next akin.
\p
\v 8 And Hanameel, my uncle's son, came to me, according to the word of the Lord, to the entry of the prison, and said me: Buy my field, which is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and thou art next of kin to possess it. And I understood that this was the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 9 And I bought the field of Hanameel, my uncle's son, that is in Anathoth: and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten pieces of silver.
\p
\v 10 And I wrote it in a book and sealed it, and took witnesses; and I weighed him the money in the balances.
\p
\v 11 And I took the deed of the purchase, that was sealed, and the stipulations, and the ratifications, with the seals, that were on the outside.
\p
\v 12 And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch, the son of Neri, the son of Maasias, in the sight of Hanameel, my uncle's son, in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, and before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
\p
\v 13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying:
\p
\v 14 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these writings, this deed of the purchase that is sealed up, and this deed that is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
\p
\v 15 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses, and fields, and vineyards, shall be possessed again in this land.
\p
\v 16 And, after I had delivered the deed of purchase to Baruch, the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:
\p
\v 17 Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, behold thou hast made heaven and earth by thy great power, and thy stretched out arm; no word shall be hard to thee.
\p
\v 18 *Thou shewest mercy unto thousands, and returnest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them; O most mighty, great, and powerful, the Lord of hosts is thy name.
\p
\v 19 Great in counsel, and incomprehensible in thought; whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of Adam, to render unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his devices.
\p
\v 20 Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even until this day, and in Israel, and amongst men, and hast made thee a name as at this day.
\p
\v 21 And hast brought forth thy people Israel, out of the land of Egypt, with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm, and with great terror.
\p
\v 22 And hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey.
\p
\v 23 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, and they walked not in thy law: and they did not any of those things that thou didst command them to do, and all these evils are come upon them.
\p
\v 24 Behold works are built up against the city to take it: and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, by the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken, is all come to pass, as thou thyself seest.
\p
\v 25 And sayest thou to me, O Lord God: Buy a field for money, and take witnesses, whereas the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans?
\p
\v 26 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 27 Behold I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: shall any thing be hard for me?
\p
\v 28 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will deliver this city into the hands of the Chaldeans, and into the hands of the king of Babylon, and they shall take it.
\p
\v 29 And the Chaldeans that fight against this city, shall come and set it on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon whose roofs they offered sacrifice to Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to strange gods, to provoke me to wrath.
\p
\v 30 For the children of Israel, and the children of Juda, have continually done evil in my eyes from their youth: the children of Israel, who even till now provoke me with the work of their hands, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 31 For this city hath been to me a provocation and indignation from the day that they built it, until this day, in which it shall be taken out of my sight.
\p
\v 32 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel, and of the children of Juda, which they have done, provoking me to wrath, they and their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 33 And they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces: when I taught them early in the morning, and instructed them, and they would not hearken to receive instruction.
\p
\v 34 *And they have set their idols in the house, in which my name is called upon, to defile it.
\p
\v 35 And they have built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Ennom, to consecrate their sons and their daughters to Moloch: which I commanded them not, neither entered it into my heart, that they should do this abomination, and cause Juda to sin.
\p
\v 36 And now, therefore, thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, to this city, whereof you say that it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence :
\p
\v 37 Behold I will gather them together out of all the lands to which I have cast them out, in my anger, and in my wrath, and in my great indignation: and I will bring them again into this place, and will cause them to dwell securely.
\p
\v 38 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\p
\v 39 And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me all days: and that it may be well with them, and with their children after them.
\p
\v 40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, and will not cease to do them good: and I will give my fear in their heart, that they may not revolt from me.
\p
\v 41 And I will rejoice over them, when I shall do them good: and I will plant them in this land in truth, with my whole heart, and with all my soul.
\p
\v 42 For thus saith the Lord: As I have brought upon this people all this great evil: so will I bring upon them all the good that I now speak to them.
\p
\v 43 And fields shall be purchased in this land: whereof you say that it is desolate, because there remaineth neither man nor beast, and it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
\p
\v 44 Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be written and sealed, and witnesses shall be taken, in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, in the cities of Juda, and in the cities on the mountains, and in the cities of the plains, and in the cities that are towards the south: for I will bring back their captivity, saith the Lord.

Jeremias now consented, to shew that the people should return to possess the land, though it was now in the enemy's hands.

At all times one religion alone can be pleasing to God, (ver. 39.) and those who were saved under the old law, must have believed in a Redeemer to come, as we must do in one already past.

Here the excellent commentary of St. Jerome ends, to our great loss. (Calmet) --- It was perhaps his last work, undertaken after the twelve minor and the other three great prophets. He never wrote on Baruch, on the epistle of Jeremias, the Greek parts of Daniel, etc., as the Jews did not allow them to be canonical, and the point was not then decided. The Church styles St. Jerome "the greatest doctor in expounding the sacred Scriptures," as he translated and illustrated the greatest part of them; (Haydock) and indeed he seems to have been the best qualified for the undertaking, of all the fathers. (Du Pin) --- Hence we may lament the more that we have not all his works in their genuine purity and perfection, as even the latest editions are very faulty, and proceed upon a plan which the learned do not approve. See A. Butler, Kennicott, etc. (Haydock)\f*

\cl Jeremias 33
\cd God promises reduction from captivity, and other blessings: especially the coming of Christ, whose reign in his Church shall be glorious and perpetual.
\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord, who will do, and will form it, and prepare it, the Lord is his name.
\p
\v 3 Cry to me, and I will hear thee: and I will shew thee great things, and sure things, which thou knowest not.
\p
\v 4 For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, to the houses of this city, and to the houses of the king of Juda, which are destroyed, and to the bulwarks, and to the sword,
\p
\v 5 Of them that come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in my wrath, and in my indignation, hiding my face from this city because of all their wickedness.
\p
\v 6 Behold I will close their wounds and give them health, and I will cure them: and I will reveal to them the prayer of peace and truth.
\p
\v 7 And I will bring back the captivity of Juda, and the captivity of Jerusalem: and I will build them as from the beginning.
\p
\v 8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me: and I will forgive all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and despised me.
\p
\v 9 And it shall be to me a name, and a joy, and a praise, and a gladness before all the nations of the earth, that shall hear of all the good things which I will do to them: and they shall fear and be troubled for all the good things, and for all the peace that I will make for them.
\p
\v 10 Thus saith the Lord: There shall be heard again in this place, (which you say is desolate, because there is neither man nor beast: in the cities of Juda, and without Jerusalem, which are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast)
\p
\v 11 The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say: Give ye glory to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good, for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring their vows into the house of the Lord: for I will bring back the captivity of the land as at the first, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 12 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: There shall be again in this place, that is desolate without man, and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, an habitation of shepherds, causing their flocks to lie down.
\p
\v 13 And in the cities on the mountains, and in the cities of the plains, and in the cities that are towards the south: and in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda shall the flocks pass again under the hand of him that numbereth them, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 14 Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform the good word that I have spoken to the house of Israel, and to the house of Juda.
\p
\v 15 In those days, and at that time, I will make the bud of justice to spring forth unto David, and he shall do judgment and justice in the earth.
\p
\v 16 In those days shall Juda be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely: and this is the name that they shall call him, The Lord our just one.
\p
\v 17 For thus saith the Lord: There shall not be cut off from David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel.
\p
\v 18 Neither shall there be cut off from the priests and Levites a man before my face, to offer holocausts, and to burn sacrifice, and to kill victims continually.
\p
\v 19 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 20 Thus saith the Lord: If my covenant with the day can be made void, and my covenant with the night, that there should not be day and night in their season:
\p
\v 21 My covenant also with David, my servant, may be made void, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne, and with the Levites and priests, my ministers.
\p
\v 22 As the stars of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David, my servant, and the Levites, my ministers.
\p
\v 23 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 24 Hast thou not seen what this people hath spoken, saying: The two families which the Lord had chosen, are cast off: and they have despised my people, so that it is no more a nation before them?
\p
\v 25 Thus saith the Lord: If I have not set my covenant between day and night, and laws to heaven and earth:
\p
\v 26 Surely I will also cast off the seed of Jacob, and of David, my servant, so as not to take any of his seed to be rulers of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will bring back their captivity, and will have mercy on them.
\f + \fr 33:1\ft Year of the World 3414, Year before Christ 590.\f*
\f + \fr 33:1\ft Time. Soon after the former. (Calmet) --- He was comforted in prison by two visions, shewing that the Church should not perish for the sins of many. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 33:2\ft Thus. Hebrew uses the feminine for the neuter. Septuagint, "forming the earth," etc.\f*
\f + \fr 33:3\ft Cry. The prophetic spirit was sometimes granted to earnest prayer, Daniel 9:2., and 10:3.\f*

\f + \fr 33:6\ft Their. The houses, wounds, or breaches. (Hebrew and Septuagint) (Calmet) --- Peace. That is, the peace and welfare which they pray for. (Challoner) --- I will teach them how to pray for a durable peace.\f*
\f + \fr 33:8\ft Iniquity, by means of the captivity, which shall be a sort of baptism, Jeremias 31:29. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 33:9\ft And it. Jerusalem, as figure of the Church. (Menochius) --- Fear, worship, and desist from persecuting God in his saints, (Haydock) whom he so highly favours.\f*
\f + \fr 33:11\ft Vows. Promised victims of thanksgiving. (Calmet) --- First, when they were settled in it under Josue. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 33:13\ft Mountains. Jeremias 32:44. --- Numbereth them, they come into the fold. (Calmet) --- Chaldean, "my people shall be instructed, and formed by the hand of the Messias." Grabe supplies what follows to the end of the chapter. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 33:15\ft Bud, or orient, Christ, (Calmet) of whom Zorobabel was a figure. (Theodoret) All cannot be verified of the latter, ver. 16. (Calmet) --- The Jews themselves explain this of the Messias. (Calov.) --- It evidently refer to him, as he was born of David, whose posterity should continue till Christ, the founder of an eternal kingdom. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 33:16\ft Him. (Septuagint, Chaldean, etc.) The Hebrew has "her" Jerusalem, or the Church, which receives all its beauty from Christ. (Calmet) --- See Jeremias 23:5., where all read him. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 33:17\ft David. This was verified in Christ, who is of the house of David; and whose kingdom in his Church shall have no end. (Challoner) --- The tribe of Juda continued most eminent till his coming. But there was no king till Hyrcan, and he was of another tribe. The priests governed after Nehemias, till Herod was appointed by the Romans. This must therefore be explained of Christ's eternal kingdom, Genesis xlix. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 33:18\ft Priests. This promise relates to the Christian priesthood; which shall also continue for ever: the functions of which (more especially the great sacrifice of the altar) are here expressed, by the name of holocausts, and other offerings of the law, which were so many figures of the Christian sacrifice. (Challoner) --- The Levitical sacrifices have ceased for 17 centuries. But Christ will officiate by his ministers till the end of time. (Calmet) --- St. Hypolitus and all the fathers agree that the blessed Eucharist is the complement of all the ancient sacrifices. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 33:21\ft Ministers. The promise in not conditional, but as unchangeable as the course of the seasons. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 33:24\ft Families of kings and priests, (Challoner) or the two kingdoms of Israel and Juda. The people complained that God had broken his word, (Calmet) so heretics assert that he has abandoned his Church for above 800 years. Providence watched in a particular manner over the families of Aaron and David, which enjoyed peculiar privileges, (Haydock) or blessings. (Worthington)\f*

\cl Jeremias 34
\cd The prophet foretells that Sedecias shall fall into the hands of Nabuchodnonosor: God's sentence upon the princes and people that had broken his covenant.
\p
\v 1 The *word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, (when Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth, that were under the power of his hand, and all the people fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof) saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Go, and speak to Sedecias, king of Juda, and say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand; but thou shalt surely be taken, and thou shalt be delivered into his hand: and thy eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
\p
\v 4 Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Sedecias, king of Juda: Thus saith the Lord to thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword.
\p
\v 5 But thou shalt die in peace, and according to the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they burn thee: and they shall mourn for thee, saying: Alas, Lord: for I have spoken the word, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 6 And Jeremias, the prophet, spoke all these words to Sedecias, the king of Juda, in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 7 And the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Juda that were left, against Lachis, and against Azecha: for these remained of the cities of Juda, fenced cities.
\p
\v 8 The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that king Sedecias had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem, making a proclamation:
\p
\v 9 That every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free: and that they should not lord it over them; to wit, over the Jews, their brethren.
\p
\v 10 And all the princes, and all the people, who entered into the covenant, heard that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant go free, and should no more have dominion over them: and they obeyed, and let them go free.
\p
\v 11 But afterwards they turned: and brought back again their servants and their handmaids, whom they had let go free, and brought them into subjection as men-servants and maid-servants.
\p
\v 12 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:
\p
\v 13 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:
\p
\v 14 *At the end of seven years, let ye go every man, his brother, being a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee, so he shall serve thee six years: and thou shalt let him go free from thee: and your fathers did not hearken to me, nor did they incline their ear.
\p
\v 15 And you turned to-day, and did that which was right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother: and you made a covenant in my sight, in the house upon which my name is invocated.
\p
\v 16 And you are fallen back, and have defiled my name: and you have brought back again every man his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, whom you had let go free, and set at liberty: and you have brought them into subjection to be your servants and handmaids.
\p
\v 17 Therefore thus saith the Lord: You have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his friend: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine: and I will cause you to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth.
\p
\v 18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, and have not performed the words of the covenant, which they agreed to in my presence, when they cut the calf in two *and passed between the parts thereof:
\p
\v 19 The princes of Juda, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land, that passed between the parts of the calf:
\p
\v 20 And I will give them into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 21 And Sedecias, the king of Juda, and his princes, I will give into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their lives, and into the hands of the armies of the king of Babylon, which are gone from you.
\p
\v 22 Behold I will command, saith the Lord, and I will bring them again to this city, and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Juda a desolation, without an inhabitant.

\cd The obedience of the Rechabites condemns the disobedience of the Jews. The reward of the Rechabites.
\p
\v 1 The *word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the days of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda, saying:
\p
\v 2 Go to the house of the Rechabites: and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers of the treasures, and thou shalt give them wine to drink.
\p
\v 3 And I took Jezonias, the son of Jeremias, the son of Habsanias, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.
\p
\v 4 And I brought them into the house of the Lord, to the treasure-house of the sons of Hanan, the son of Jegedelias, the man of God, which was by the treasure-house of the princes, above the treasure of Maasias, the son of Sellum, who was keeper of the entry.
\p
\v 5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups: and I said to them: Drink ye wine.
\p
\v 6 And they answered : We will not drink wine; because Jonadab, the son of Rechab, *our father, commanded us, saying: You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your children, for ever:
\p
\v 7 Neither shall ye build houses, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any: but you shall dwell in tents all your days, that you may live many days upon the face of the earth, in which you are strangers.
\p
\v 8 Therefore we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father, in all things that he commanded us, so as to drink no wine all our days: neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters:
\p
\v 9 Nor to build houses to dwell in, nor to have vineyard, or field, or seed:
\p
\v 10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have been obedient according to all that Jonadab, our father, commanded us.
\p
\v 11 But when Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came up to our land, we said: Come, let us go into Jerusalem, from the face of the army of the Chaldeans, and from the face of the army of Syria: and we have remained in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 12 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 13 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will you not receive instruction, to obey my words, saith the Lord ?
\p
\v 14 The words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, by which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have prevailed: and they have drunk none to this day, because they have obeyed the commandment of their father: but I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, and you have not obeyed me.
\p
\v 15 And I have sent to you all my servants, the prophets, rising early, and sending and saying: *Return ye every man from his wicked way, and make your ways good: and follow not strange gods, nor worship them, and you shall dwell in the land which I gave you and your fathers: and you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.
\p
\v 16 So the sons of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, have constantly kept the commandment of their father, which he commanded them: but this people hath not obeyed me.
\p
\v 17 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, and they have not heard: I have called to them, and they have not answered me.
\p
\v 18 And Jeremias said to the house of the Rechabites: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab, your father, and have kept all his precepts, and have done all that he commanded you:
\p
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord of host, the God of Israel: There shall not be wanting a man of the race of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, standing before me for ever.

Thus various religious orders, both of men and of women, have flourished in the Church, and though they have different names and regulations, yet they are not sects, as heretics would pretend, but all follow the same faith, use the same sacraments, and are a great ornament to the Catholic Church by their profession of the three essential vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, in imitation of the apostles, Matthew 19:12. --- Joakim.

\cl Jeremias 36
\cd Jeremias sends Baruch to read his prophecies in the temple: the book is brought to king Joakim, who burns it. The prophet denounces his judgment, and causes Baruch to write a new copy.
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass *in the fourth year of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda, that this word came to Jeremias by the Lord, saying:
\p
\v 2 Take thee a roll of a book, and thou shalt write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel and Juda, and against all the nations from the day that I spoke to thee, from the days of Josias even to this day.
\p
\v 3 If so be, when the house of Juda shall hear all the evils that I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his wicked way: and I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin.
\p
\v 4 So Jeremias called Baruch, the son of Nerias: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias, all the words of the Lord, which he spoke to him, upon the roll of a book.
\p
\v 5 And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying: I am shut up, and cannot go into the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 Go thou in, therefore, and read out of the volume which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people in the house of the Lord, on the fasting day; and, also, thou shalt read them in the hearing of all Juda, that come out of their cities:
\p
\v 7 If so be, they may present their supplication before the Lord, and may return every one from his wicked way; for great is the wrath and indignation which the Lord hath pronounced against this people.
\p
\v 8 And Baruch, the son of Nerias, did according to all that Jeremias, the prophet, had commanded him, reading out of the volume the words of the Lord, in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that were come together out of the cities of Juda to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 10 And Baruch read out of the volume the words of Jeremias, in the house of the Lord, in the treasury of Gamarias, the son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people.
\p
\v 11 And when Micheas, the son of Gamarias, the son of Saphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord,
\p
\v 12 He went down into the king's house, to the secretary's chamber; and behold all the princes sat there; Elisama, the scribe, and Dalaias, the son of Semeias, and Elnathan, the son of Achobor, and Gamarias, the son of Saphan, and Sedecias, the son of Hananias, and all the princes.
\p
\v 13 And Micheas told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read out of the volume in the hearing of the people.
\p
\v 14 Therefore all the princes sent Judi, the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, to Baruch, saying: Take in thy hand the volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the people, and come. So Baruch, the son of Nerias, took the volume in his hand, and came to them.
\p
\v 15 And they said to him: Sit down and read these things in our hearing. And Baruch read in their hearing.
\p
\v 16 And when they had heard all the words, they looked upon one another with astonishment, and they said to Baruch: We must tell the king all these words.
\p
\v 17 And they asked him, saying: Tell us how didst thou write all these words from his mouth.
\p
\v 18 And Baruch said to them: With his mouth he pronounced all these words as if he were reading to me: and I wrote in a volume with ink.
\p
\v 19 And the princes said to Baruch: Go, and hide thee, both thou and Jeremias, and let no man know where you are.
\p
\v 20 And they went in to the king, into the court; but they laid up the volume in the chamber of Elisama, the scribe; and they told all the words in the hearing of the king.
\p
\v 21 And the king sent Judi that he should take the volume: who, bringing it out of the chamber of Elisama, the scribe, read it in the hearing of the king, and of all the princes that stood about the king.
\p
\v 22 Now the king sat in the winter-house, In the ninth month; and there was a hearth before him, full of burning coals.
\p
\v 23 And when Judi had read three or four pages, he cut it with the penknife, and he cast it into the fire that was upon the hearth, till all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on the hearth.
\p
\v 24 And the king, and all his servants that heard all these words, were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments.
\p
\v 25 But yet Elnathan, and Dalaias, and Gamarias spoke to the king, not to burn the book; and he heard them not.
\p
\v 26 And the king commanded Jeremiel, the son of Amelech, and Saraias, the son of Ezriel, and Selemias, the son of Abdeel, to take up Baruch, the scribe, and Jeremias, the prophet: but the Lord hid them.
\p
\v 27 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, the prophet, after that the king had burnt the volume, and the words that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 28 Take thee again another volume: and write in it all the former words that were in the first volume, which Joakim, the king of Juda, hath burnt.
\p
\v 29 And thou shalt say to Joakim, the king of Juda: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast burnt that volume, saying: Why hast thou written therein, and said: The king of Babylon shall come speedily, and shall lay waste this land; and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
\p
\v 30 Therefore thus saith the Lord against Joakim, the king of Juda: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night.
\p
\v 31 And I will punish him, and his seed: and his servants for their iniquities, and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Juda, all the evil that I have pronounced against them: but they have not heard.
\p
\v 32 And Jeremias took another volume, and gave it to Baruch, the son of Nerias, the scribe; who wrote in it, from the mouth of Jeremias, all the words of the book which Joakim, the king of Juda, had burnt with fire; and there were added besides, many more words than had been before.

\f + \fr 36:1\ft Fourth, towards the conclusion, after the siege was raised, ver. 6, 9.\f*
\f + \fr 36:2\ft Write. He had already prophesied 22 years. Now he was more frequently ordered to write. (Calmet) --- He executed the order by the hand of Baruch, ver. 4.\f*
\f + \fr 36:3\ft If. This indicates free-will. (Haydock) --- God makes this last effort, that the hearing of so many separate prophecies together might make a deeper impression.\f*
\f + \fr 36:4\ft Book. This was afterwards burnt. What he wrote a second time has not come down to us, in the same order. Jeremias made use of his memory, which was directed by the Holy Spirit. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 36:5\ft Shut up. Not that the prophet was now in prison; for the contrary appears from ver. 19., but that he kept himself shut up, by reason of the persecutions he had lately met with. See Jeremias 26. (Challoner) --- If he had been confined, as Grotius asserts, the king would easily have found him. (Calmet) --- He and Baruch retired to some secret place, as most priests (Worthington) did formerly in England, (Haydock) that they might better exercise their functions than they could do in the hands of the persecutors. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 36:6\ft Read. This may sometimes have as good an effect as preaching without a book. (Haydock) --- Fasting day of expiation, (Usher, the year of the world 3398) or rather on (Haydock) the day prescribed in the 9th month, ver. 9. (Lyranus) (Tirinus)\f*
\f + \fr 36:7\ft They. Literally, "their supplication may fall prostrate before," etc. (Haydock) --- It is personified. So Homer represents (Calmet) "supplications," as daughters of Jupiter, lame, and with eyes averted, (Iliad ix.) to shew how we ought to pray. Jeremias finds means to instruct the people: the word of God is not bound, 2 Timothy 2:9. (Calmet) --- As many refused to hear his discourses, God ordered him to write what might be a perpetual warning and reproach, or testimony against them. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 36:9\ft Fast. Probably on account of the catastrophe the second year, Daniel 1:2. Many such were afterwards appointed, Zacharias 7:3., and 8:19. All came to Jerusalem on such occasions.\f*

\f + \fr 36:18\ft Reading. No study was requisite. (Haydock) --- Ink. It formerly resembled that used by printers, (Calmet) being composed of soot and gum. (Vitruvius 7:10.)\f*
\f + \fr 36:19\ft Are. Thus they provide for the safety of the prophets, and perform their duty to the king.\f*
\f + \fr 36:21\ft Read it. This was the third time. It was in vain afterwards to destroy the book.\f*
\f + \fr 36:22\ft Winter-house. He was very magnificent, and had other apartments for summer. Though the climate was warm, fires would be useful in November. --- Hearth. There was no chimney used, and the smoke went out by the door, or by holes at the top of the room, as we see in some old monasteries. (Calmet) --- Charcoal was probably used, Baruch 6:42.\f*
\f + \fr 36:23\ft Pages. Perhaps what was written on so many skins, (Haydock) or sheets of paper, pasted together, and rolled up; or there might be some marks to shew the different subjects, like the sections used in the synagogue, (Calmet) or our chapters; though we are assured that all was formerly written without any separation even of letters. Protestants have "leaves." (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "doors." (Calmet) The secretary cut and burnt the leaves by the king's order, ver. 25. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 36:24\ft Afraid. They saw all without any concern, not believing that God spoke to them. They did not imitate Josias, 2 Paralipomenon 34:19.\f*
\f + \fr 36:26\ft Hid them, and prevented any one from betraying them. (Calmet) --- He did not remove them to a place different from what they had chosen by his direction. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 36:30\ft None, etc. Because his son, Joachin or Jechonias, within three months after the death of his father, was carried away to Babylon, so that his reign is not worthy to be taken notice of. (Challoner) (Theodoret) (Worthington) --- He was subject to the Chaldeans; his uncle took his place. Joakim had the burial of an ass, Jeremias 12:18. (Calmet) --- None of the following princes enjoyed the glory or power of the ancient king. (St. Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologiae] p. 3. qu. 31. a. 2.) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 36:32\ft Before. We cannot tell what. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "many like words." (Haydock)\f*

\cl Jeremias 37
\cd Jeremias prophesies that the Chaldeans, who had departed from Jerusalem, would return and burn the city. He is cast into prison. His conference with Sedecias.
\p
\v 1 Now king Sedecias, the *son of Josias, reigned instead of Jechonias, the son of Joakim; whom Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, made king in the land of Juda.
\p
\v 2 *But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did obey the words of the Lord, that he spoke in the hand of Jeremias, the prophet.
\p
\v 3 And *king Sedecias sent Juchal, the son of Selemias, and Sophonias, the son of Maasias, the priest, to Jeremias, the prophet, saying: Pray to the Lord, our God, for us.
\p
\v 4 Now Jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people; for they had not as yet cast him into prison. And the army of Pharao was come out of Egypt: and the Chaldeans, that besieged Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, saying:
\p
\v 6 Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Juda, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into Egypt.
\p
\v 7 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.
\p
\v 8 Thus saith the Lord: Deceive not your souls, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall not go away.
\p
\v 9 But if you should even beat all the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded men; they shall rise up, every man from his tent, and burn this city with fire.
\p
\v 10 Now, when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem, because of Pharao's army,
\p
\v 11 Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem, to go into the land of Benjamin, and to divide a possession there in the presence of the citizens.
\p
\v 12 And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin, the captain of the gate, who was there in his turn, was one named Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of Jeremias, the prophet, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.
\p
\v 13 And Jeremias answered: It is not so; I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremias, and brought him to the princes.
\p
\v 14 Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias: and they beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan, the scribe; for he was chief over the prison.
\p
\v 15 So Jeremias went into the house of the prison, and into the dungeon: and Jeremias remained there many days.
\p
\v 16 Then Sedecias, the king, sending, took him: and asked him secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the Lord? And Jeremias said: There is. And he said: Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 17 And Jeremias said to king Sedecias: In what have I offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into prison?
\p
\v 18 Where are your prophets that prophesied to you, and said: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, and against this land?
\p
\v 19 Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king; let my petition be accepted in thy sight; and send me not back into the house of Jonathan, the scribe, lest I die there.
\p
\v 20 Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be committed into the entry of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the city was spent: and Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.

\cl Jeremias 38
\cd The prophet, at the instance of the great men, is cast into a filthy dungeon: his is drawn out by Abdemelech, and has another conference with the king.
\p
\v 1 Now *Saphatias, the son of Mathan, and Gedelias, the son of Phassur, and Juchal, the son of Selemias, and Phassur, the son of Melchias, heard the words that Jeremias spoke to all the people, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord: *Whosoever shall remain in this city, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: but he that shall go forth to the Chaldeans, shall live, and his life shall be safe, and he shall live.
\p
\v 3 Thus saith the Lord: This city shall surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
\p
\v 4 And the princes said to the king: We beseech thee that this man may be put to death: for on purpose he weakeneth the hands of the men of war, that remain in this city, and the hands of the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man seeketh not peace to this people, but evil.
\p
\v 5 And king Sedecias said: Behold he is in your hands: for it is not lawful for the king to deny you any thing.
\p
\v 6 Then they took Jeremias, and cast him into the dungeon of Melchias, the son of Amelech, which was in the entry of the prison: and they let down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there was no water, but mire. And Jeremias sunk into the mire.
\p
\v 7 Now Abdemelech, the Ethiopian, an eunuch that was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon: but the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin.
\p
\v 8 And Abdemelech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying:
\p
\v 9 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done against Jeremias, the prophet, casting him into the dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.
\p
\v 10 Then the king commanded Abdemelech, the Ethiopian, saying: Take from hence thirty men with thee, and draw up Jeremias, the prophet, out of the dungeon, before he die.
\p
\v 11 So Abdemelech, taking the men with him, went into the king's house that was under the storehouse; and he took from thence old rags, and old rotten things, and he let them down by cords to Jeremias, into the dungeon.
\p
\v 12 And Abdemelech, the Ethiopian, said to Jeremias: Put these old rags, and these rent and rotten things, under thy arms, and upon the cords: and Jeremias did so.
\p
\v 13 And they drew up Jeremias with the cords, and brought him forth out of the dungeon. And Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.
\p
\v 14 And king Sedecias sent, and took Jeremias, the prophet, to him to the third gate, that was in the house of the Lord: and the king said to Jeremias: I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
\p
\v 15 Then Jeremias said to Sedecias: If I shall declare it to thee, wilt thou not put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken to me.
\p
\v 16 Then king Sedecias swore to Jeremias, in private, saying: As the Lord liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, nor will I deliver thee into the hands of these men that seek thy life.
\p
\v 17 And Jeremias said to Sedecias: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt take a resolution and go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burnt with fire; and thou shalt be safe, and thy house.
\p
\v 18 But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of Babylon, this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire; and thou shalt not escape out of their hands.
\p
\v 19 And king Sedecias said to Jeremias: I am afraid, because of the Jews that are fled over to the Chaldeans: lest I should be delivered into their hands, and they should abuse me.
\p
\v 20 But Jeremias answered: They shall not deliver thee; hearken, I beseech thee, to the word of the Lord, which I speak to thee, and it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.
\p
\v 21 But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord hath shewn me:
\p
\v 22 Behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda, shall be brought out to the princes of the king of Babylon: and they shall say: Thy men of peace have deceived thee, and have prevailed against thee, they have plunged thy feet in the mire, and in a slippery place, and they have departed from thee.
\p
\v 23 And all thy wives, and thy children, shall be brought out to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape their hands, but thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon; and he shall burn this city with fire.
\p
\v 24 Then Sedecias said to Jeremias: Let no man know these words, and thou shalt not die.
\p
\v 25 But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee: Tell us what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee: and also what the king said to thee:
\p
\v 26 Thou shalt say to them: I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not command me to be carried back into the house of Jonathan, to die there.
\p
\v 27 So all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him: and he spoke to them according to all the words that the king had commanded him: and they left him: for nothing had been heard.
\p
\v 28 But Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison, until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and it came to pass that Jerusalem was taken.

\cl Jeremias 39
\cd After two years' siege, Jerusalem is taken. Sedecias is carried before Nabuchodonosor, who kills his sons in his sight, and then puts out his eyes. Jeremias is set at liberty.
\p
\v 1 In the ninth year *of Sedecias, king of Juda, in the tenth month, came Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, and all his army to Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
\p
\v 2 And in the *eleventh year of Sedecias, in the fourth month, the fifth day of the month, the city was opened.
\p
\v 3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate: Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rabsares, Neregel, Sereser, Rebmag, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 4 And when Sedecias, the king of Juda, and all the men of war, saw them, they fled: and they went forth in the night out of the city, by the way of the king's garden, and by the gate that was between the two walls, and they went out to the way of the desert.
\p
\v 5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them; and they took Sedecias in the plain of the desert of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave judgment upon him.
\p
\v 6 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias, in Reblatha, before his eyes: and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Juda.
\p
\v 7 He also put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with fetters, to be carried to Babylon.
\p
\v 8 And the Chaldeans burnt the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire; and they threw down the wall of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 9 And Nabuzardan, the general of the army, carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to him, and the rest of the people that remained.
\p
\v 10 But Nabuzardan, the general, left some of the poor people, that had nothing at all in the land of Juda, and he gave them vineyards and cisterns at that time.
\p
\v 11 Now Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, had given charge to Nabuzardan, the general, concerning Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 12 Take him, and set thy eyes upon him, and do him no harm; but as he hath a mind, so do with him.
\p
\v 13 Therefore Nabuzardan, the general, sent; and Nabusezban, and Rabsares, and Neregel, and Sereser, and Rebmag, and all the nobles of the king of Babylon,
\p
\v 14 Sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, that he might go home and dwell among the people.
\p
\v 15 But the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, when he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying: Go, and tell Abdemelech, the Ethiopian, saying:
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words upon this city unto evil, and not unto good: and they shall be accomplished in thy sight, in that day.
\p
\v 17 And I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord; and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou fearest:
\p
\v 18 But delivering, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword; but thy life shall be saved for thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.

\cd Jeremias remains with Godolias, the governor; who receives all the Jews that resort to him.
\p
\v 1 The *word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that Nabuzardan, the general, had let him go from Rama, when he had taken him, being bound with chains, among all them that were carried away from Jerusalem and Juda, and were carried to Babylon.
\p
\v 2 And the general of the army taking Jeremias, said to him: The Lord, thy God, hath pronounced this evil upon this place.
\p
\v 3 And he hath brought it: and the Lord hath done as he hath said: because you have sinned against the Lord, and have not hearkened to his voice, and this word is come upon you.
\p
\v 4 Now then, behold I have loosed thee this day from the chains which were upon thy hands: if it please thee to come with me to Babylon, come: and I will set my eyes upon thee: but if it do not please thee to come with me to Babylon, stay here: behold all the land is before thee, as thou shalt choose, and whither it shall please thee to go, thither go.
\p
\v 5 And come not with me: but dwell with Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Juda: dwell, therefore, with him in the midst of the people: or whithersoever it shall please thee to go, go. And the general of the army gave him victuals and presents, and let him go.
\p
\v 6 And Jeremias went to Godolias, the son of Ahicam, to Masphath: and dwelt with him in the midst of the people, that were left in the land.
\p
\v 7 And when all the captains of the army that were scattered through the countries, they and their companions, had heard that the king of Babylon had made Godolias, the son of Ahicam, governor of the country, and that he had committed unto him men and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, them that had not been carried away captive to Babylon:
\p
\v 8 They came to Godolias, to Masphath: and Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, and Johanan, and Jonathan, the sons of Caree, and Sareas, the son of Thanehumeth, and the children of Ophi, that were of Netophathi, and Jezonias, the son of Maachati, they and their men.
\p
\v 9 *And Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, swore to them, and to their companions, saying: Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\p
\v 10 Behold, I dwell in Masphath, that I may answer the commandment of the Chaldeans that are sent to us; but as for you, gather ye the vintage, and the harvest, and the oil, and lay it up in your vessels, and abide in your cities which you hold.
\p
\v 11 Moreover, all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and in all the countries, when they heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judea, and that he had made Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan ruler over them:
\p
\v 12 All the Jews, I say, returned out of all the places to which they had fled, and they came into the land of Juda, to Godolias, to Masphath; and they gathered wine, and a very great harvest.
\p
\v 13 Then Johanan, the son of Caree, and all the captains of the army, that had been scattered about the countries, came to Godolias, to Masphath.
\p
\v 14 And they said to him: Know that Baalis, the king of the children of Ammon, hath sent Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, to kill thee. And Godolias, the son of Ahicam, believed them not.
\p
\v 15 But Johanan, the son of Caree, spoke to Godolias privately in Masphath, saying: I will go, and I will kill Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, and no man shall know it, lest he kill thee, and all the Jews be scattered, that are gathered unto thee, and the remnant of Juda perish.
\p
\v 16 And Godolias, the son of Ahicam, said to Johanan, the son of Caree: Do not this thing: for what thou sayest of Ismahel is false.

\cd Godolias is slain: the Jews that were with him are apprehensive of the Chaldeans.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama, of the royal blood, and the nobles of the king, and ten men with him, came to Godolias, the son of Ahicam, into Masphath: and they eat bread there together in Masphath.
\p
\v 2 And Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, arose, and the ten men that were with him, and they struck Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, with the sword, and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\p
\v 3 Ismahel slew also all the Jews that were with Godolias in Masphath, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the soldiers.
\p
\v 4 And on the second day after he had killed Godolias, no man yet knowing it,
\p
\v 5 There came some from Sichem, and from Silo, and from Samaria, fourscore men, with their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and mourning: and they had offerings and incense in their hand, to offer in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 And Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, went forth from Masphath to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and when he had met them, he said to them: Come to Godolias, the son of Ahicam.
\p
\v 7 And when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.
\p
\v 8 But ten men were found among them, that said to Ismahel : Kill us not; for we have stores in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. And he forbore, and slew them not with their brethren.
\p
\v 9 And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he slew, because of Godolias, is the same that king Asa made, for fear of Baasa, the king of Israel: the same did Ismahel, the son of Nathanias fill, with them that were slain.
\p
\v 10 Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Masphath: the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Masphath; whom Nabuzardan, the general of the army, had committed to Godolias, the son of Ahicam. And Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, took them, and he departed, to go over to the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 11 But Johanan, the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, heard of the evil that Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, had done.
\p
\v 12 And taking all the men, they went out to fight against Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, and they found him by the great waters that are in Gabaon.
\p
\v 13 And when all the people that were with Ismahel, had seen Johanan, the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, they rejoiced.
\p
\v 14 And all the people whom Ismahel had taken, went back to Masphath: and they returned and went to Johanan, the son of Caree.
\p
\v 15 But Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, fled with eight men, from the face of Johanan, and went to the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 16 Then Johanan, the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom they had recovered from Ismahel, the son of Nathanias, from Masphath, after that he had slain Godolias, the son of Ahicam: valiant men for war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gabaon:
\p
\v 17 And they departed, and sat as sojourners in Chamaam, which is near Bethlehem: in order to go forward, and enter into Egypt,
\p

\p
\v 9 And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me, to present your supplications before him:
\p
\v 10 If you will be quiet and remain in this land, I will build you up, and not pull you down: I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for now I am appeased for the evil that I have done to you.
\p
\v 11 Fear not, because of the king of Babylon, of whom you are greatly afraid: fear him not, saith the Lord; for I am with you, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.
\p
\v 12 And I will shew mercies to you, and will take pity on you, and will cause you to dwell in your own land.
\p
\v 13 But if you say: We will not dwell in this land, neither will we hearken to the voice of the Lord our God,
\p
\v 14 Saying: No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor suffer hunger: and there we will dwell.
\p
\v 15 For this now hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Juda: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to go into Egypt, and enter in to dwell there:
\p
\v 16 The sword which you fear, shall overtake you there, in the land of Egypt: and the famine, whereof you are afraid, shall cleave to you in Egypt, and there you shall die.
\p
\v 17 And all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt, to dwell there, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: none of them shall remain, nor escape from the face of the evil that I will bring upon them.
\p
\v 18 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my indignation hath been kindled against the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my indignation be kindled against you, when you shall enter into Egypt, and you shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.
\p
\v 19 This is the word of the Lord concerning you, O ye remnant of Juda: Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have adjured you this day.
\p
\v 20 For you have deceived your own souls; for you sent me to the Lord our God, saying: Pray for us to the Lord our God, and according to all that the Lord our God shall say to thee, so declare unto us, and we will do it.
\p
\v 21 And now I have declared it to you this day, and you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, with regard to all the things for which he hath sent me to you.
\p
\v 22 Now, therefore, know certainly that you shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence in the place to which you desire to go to dwell there.

\cd The Jews, contrary to the orders of God, by the prophet, go into Egypt, carrying Jeremias with them. He foretells the devastation of that land by the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass, that when Jeremias had made an end of speaking to the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them, all these words:
\p
\v 2 Azarias, the son of Osaias, and Johanan, the son of Caree, and all the proud men, made answer, saying, to Jeremias: Thou tellest a lie; the Lord our God hath not sent thee, saying: Go not into Egypt, to dwell there.
\p
\v 3 But Baruch, the son of Nerias, setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and to cause us to be carried away captives to Babylon.
\p
\v 4 So Johanan, the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Juda.
\p
\v 5 But Johanan, the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers, took all the remnant of Juda, that were returned out of all nations, to which they had before been scattered, to dwell in the land of Juda:
\p
\v 6 Men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every soul, which Nabuzardan, the general, had left with Godolias, the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, and Jeremias, the prophet, and Baruch, the son of Nerias.
\p
\v 7 And they went into the land of Egypt, for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: and they came as far as Taphnis.
\p
\v 8 And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, in Taphnis, saying:
\p
\v 9 Take great stones in thy hand, and thou shalt hide them in the vault that is under the brick wall at the gate of Pharao's house in Taphnis: in the sight of the men of Juda.
\p
\v 10 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send, and take Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, my servant; and I will set his throne over these stones which I have hid, and he shall set his throne over them.
\p
\v 11 And he shall come and strike the land of Egypt: such as are for death, to death; and such as are for captivity, to captivity; and such as are for the sword, to the sword.
\p
\v 12 And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them, and he shall carry them away captives; and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.

\cl Jeremias 44
\cd The prophet's admonition to the Jews, in Egypt, against idolatry, is not regarded: he denounces to them their destruction.
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremias, concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, dwelling in Magdal, and in Taphnis, and in Memphis, and in the land of Phatures, saying:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all this evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Juda; and behold they are desolate this day, and there is not an inhabitant in them:
\p
\v 3 Because of the wickedness which they have committed, to provoke me to wrath, and to go and offer sacrifice, and worship other gods, which neither they, nor you, nor your fathers knew.
\p
\v 4 And I sent to you all my servants, the prophets, rising early, and sending, and saying: Do not commit this abominable thing, which I hate.
\p
\v 5 But they heard not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their evil ways, and not to sacrifice to strange gods.
\p
\v 6 Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and they are turned to desolation and waste, as at this day.
\p
\v 7 And now thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against your own souls, that there should die of you man and woman, child and suckling, out of the midst of Juda, and no remnant should be left you:
\p
\v 8 In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, by sacrificing to other gods, in the land of Egypt, into which you are come to dwell there: and that you should perish, and be a curse, and a reproach to all the nations of the earth?
\p
\v 9 Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Juda, and the evils of their wives, and your evils, and the evils of your wives, that they have done in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\p
\v 10 They are not cleansed even to this day; neither have they feared, nor walked in the law of the Lord, nor in my commandments, which I set before you and your fathers.
\p
\v 11 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: *Behold, I will set my face upon you for evil; and I will destroy all Juda.
\p
\v 12 And I will take the remnant of Juda that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt, and to dwell there: and they shall be all consumed in the land of Egypt: they shall fall by the sword, and by the famine: and they shall be consumed, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword, and by the famine shall they die: and they shall be for an execration, and for a wonder, and for a curse, and for a reproach.
\p
\v 13 And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence.
\p
\v 14 And there shall be none that shall escape, and remain, of the remnant of the Jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of Egypt: and that shall return into the land of Juda, to which they have a desire to return, to dwell there: there shall none return but they that shall flee.
\p
\v 15 Then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to other gods: and all the women, of whom there stood by a great multitude, and all the people of them that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Phatures, answered Jeremias, saying:
\p
\v 16 As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee:
\p
\v 17 But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of our own mouth, to sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and we were filled with bread, and it was well with us, and we saw no evil.
\p
\v 18 But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword, and by famine.
\p
\v 19 And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink-offerings to her: did we make cakes to worship her, to pour out drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?
\p
\v 20 And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying:
\p
\v 21 Was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, which the Lord hath remembered, and hath it not entered into his heart?
\p
\v 22 So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed: therefore your land is become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
\p
\v 23 Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned against the Lord: and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his law, and in his commandments, and in his testimonies: therefore are these evils come upon you, as at this day.
\p
\v 24 And Jeremias said to all the people, and to all the women: Hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt:
\p
\v 25 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: You and your wives have spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled with your hands, saying: Let us perform our vows which we have made, to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her: you have fulfilled your vows, and have performed them indeed.
\p
\v 26 Therefore, hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord: that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Juda, in the land of Egypt, saying: The Lord God liveth.
\p
\v 27 Behold I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Juda that are in the land of Egypt, shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine, till there be an end of them.
\p
\v 28 And a few men that shall flee from the sword, shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Juda: and all the remnant of Juda that are gone into the land of Egypt, to dwell there, shall know, whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
\p
\v 29 And this shall be a sign to you, saith the Lord, that I will punish you in this place: that you may know that my words shall be accomplished indeed against you for evil.
\p
\v 30 Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver Pharao Ephree, king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life: as I delivered Sedecias, king of Juda, into the hand of Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.

\v 2 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharao Nechao, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates, in Charcamis, whom Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, defeated, in the fourth year *of Joakim, the son of Josias, king of Juda.
\p
\v 3 Prepare ye the shield and buckler, and go forth to battle.
\p
\v 4 Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen; stand forth with helmets, furbish the spears, put on coats of mail.
\p
\v 5 What then? I have seen them dismayed, and turning their backs, their valiant ones slain: they fled apace, and they looked not back: terror was round about, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 6 Let not the swift flee away, nor the strong think to escape: they are overthrown, and fallen down, towards the north, by the river Euphrates.
\p
\v 7 Who is this that cometh up as a flood: and his streams swell like those of rivers?
\p
\v 8 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and the waves thereof shall be moved as rivers, and he shall say: I will go up, and will cover the earth: I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.
\p
\v 9 Get ye up on horses, and glory in chariots, and let the valiant men come forth, the Ethiopians, and the Lybians, that hold the shield, and the Lydians that take, and shoot arrows.
\p
\v 10 For this is the day of the Lord, the God of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may revenge himself of his enemies: the sword shall devour, and shall be filled, and shall be drunk with their blood: for there is a sacrifice of the Lord God of hosts in the north country, by the river Euphrates.
\p
\v 11 Go up into Galaad, and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain dost thou multiply medicines, there shall be no cure for thee.

\p
\v 14 Declare ye to Egypt, and publish in Magdal, *and let it be known in Memphis, and in Taphnis: say ye: Stand up, and prepare thyself: for the sword shall devour all round about thee.
\p
\v 15 Why are thy valiant men come to nothing? they stood not: because the Lord hath overthrown them,
\p
\v 16 He hath multiplied them that fall, and one hath fallen upon another, and they shall say: Arise, and let us return to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the sword of the dove.
\p
\v 17 Call ye the name of Pharao, king of Egypt, a tumult time hath brought.
\p
\v 18 As I live (saith the king, whose name is the Lord of hosts) as Thabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.
\p
\v 19 Furnish thyself to go into captivity, thou daughter inhabitant of Egypt: for Memphis shall be made desolate, and shall be forsaken and uninhabited.
\p
\v 20 Egypt is like a fair and beautiful heifer: there shall come from the north one that shall goad her.
\p
\v 21 Her hirelings also that lived in the midst of her, like fatted calves are turned back, and are fled away together, and they could not stand: for the day of their slaughter is come upon them, the time of their visitation.

\v 22 Her voice shall sound like brass, for they shall hasten with an army, and with axes they shall come against her, as hewers of wood.
\p
\v 23 They have cut down her forest, saith the Lord, which cannot be counted: they are multiplied above locusts, and are without number.
\p
\v 24 The daughter of Egypt is confounded, and delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

\v 26 And I will deliver them into the hand of them that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterwards it shall be inhabited *as in the days of old, saith the Lord.

\v 27 *And thou, my servant, Jacob, fear not and be not thou dismayed, O Israel: for behold I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed out of the land of thy captivity: and Jacob shall return, and be at rest, and prosper: and there shall be none to terrify him.

\cd A prophecy of the desolation of the Philistines, of Tyre, Sidon, Gaza, and Ascalon.
\p
\v 1 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias, the prophet, against the people of Palestine, before Pharao took Gaza:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord: Behold there come up waters out of the north, and they shall be as an overflowing torrent, and they shall cover the land, and all that is therein, the city, and the inhabitants thereof: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl,
\p
\v 3 At the noise of the marching of arms, and of his soldiers, at the rushing of his chariots, and the multitude of his wheels. The fathers have not looked back to the children, for feebleness of hands,
\p
\v 4 Because of the coming of the day, in which all the Philistines shall be laid waste, and Tyre, and Sidon shall be destroyed, with all the rest of their helpers. For the Lord hath wasted the Philistines, *the remnant of the isle of Cappadocia.
\p
\v 5 Baldness is come upon Gaza: Ascalon hath held her peace, with the remnant of their valley: how long shalt thou cut thyself?
\p
\v 6 O thou sword of the Lord, how long wilt thou not be quiet? Go into thy scabbard, rest and be still.
\p
\v 7 How shall it be quiet, when the Lord hath given it a charge against Ascalon, and against the countries thereof by the sea side, and there hath made an appointment for it.
\x + \xo 47:4\xt Deuteronomy 2:23.; Amos 9:7.\x*
\f + \fr 47:1\ft Gaza, going or returning from Charcamis. Apries also attacked Tyre, and would of course invade the Philistines. They had assisted the Tyrians against Nabuchodonosor, who therefore made incursions into their territory, and into that of Ammon, etc., while the main part of his army besieged Tyre for thirteen years. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 47:3\ft Marching. Literally, "pomp," (Haydock) or warlike apparatus. (Haydock) --- Protestants, "stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at," etc. (Haydock) --- Children. Fear makes one forget the nearest relations, while each one provides for himself, Jeremias 9:4., Micheas 7:5., and Matthew 10:35.\f*
\f + \fr 47:4\ft Tyre. See Jeremias 47:4., and Ezechiel xxvi., etc. --- Sidon. It had rejoiced at the downfall of its rival, (Isaias 23:4.) and of the Jews, Joel 3:4., and Ezechiel 28:24. Artax Ochus punished it severely; (Calmet) and its own king, Tenner, betrayed his subjects, who were slain by the Persians, or burnt themselves in the conflagration of the city. (Diodorus, Olym. 177. a. 2.) --- Helpers; Philistines, who came originally from the isle of Caphtor, or Crete. --- Cappadocia was not an island, or near the sea, (Calmet) but at a distance from the Jews. (Sanctius)\f*
\f + \fr 47:5\ft Baldness, the sign of mourning, (Calmet) or captivity. (Haydock) --- Peace. Hebrew, "shall be destroyed." Septuagint, "cast away." She has afforded no assistance to Gaza. (Haydock) --- Valley, along the Mediterranean. (Calmet) --- Literally, "And ye remnants of their valley, how?" etc. --- Cut, in despair or grief, Jeremias 41:5. Septuagint, "Remnants of the Enakeim, (giants) how long wilt thou make incisions?" (Haydock) --- The race of Enack dwelt in those parts; though Ã¡nkim seems to have been mistaken for ankom.

\cd A prophecy of the desolation of Moab, for their pride: but their captivity shall at last be released.
\p
\v 1 Against *Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to Nabo, for it is laid waste, and confounded: Cariathaim is taken: the strong city is confounded, and hath trembled.
\p
\v 2 There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Hesebon: they have devised evil. Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Therefore, shalt thou in silence hold thy peace, and the sword shall follow thee.
\p
\v 3 A voice of crying from Oronaim: waste and great destruction.
\p
\v 4 Moab is destroyed; proclaim a cry for her little ones.
\p
\v 5 For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping; for in the descent of Oronaim, the enemies have heard a howling of destruction:
\p
\v 6 Flee, save your lives; and be *as heath in the wilderness.
\p
\v 7 For because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken; and Chamos shall go into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.
\p
\v 8 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; and the valleys shall perish, and the plains shall be destroyed, for the Lord hath spoken:
\p
\v 9 Give a flower to Moab, for in its flower it shall go out; and the cities thereof shall be desolate, and uninhabited.
\p
\v 10 Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood.
\p
\v 11 Moab hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested upon his lees; and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel, nor hath gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
\p
\v 12 Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send him men that shall order and overturn his bottles, and they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles one against another.
\p
\v 13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, *as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, in which they trusted.
\p
\v 14 *How do you say: We are valiant, and stout men in battle?
\p
\v 15 Moab is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities; and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the king, whose name is the Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 16 The destruction of Moab is near to come: the calamity thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly.
\p
\v 17 Comfort him, all you that are round about him; and all you that know his name, say: How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod?
\p
\v 18 Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, O dwelling of the daughter of Dibon; because the spoiler of Moab is come up to thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks.
\p
\v 19 Stand in the way, and look out, O habitation of Aroer: enquire of him that fleeth, and say to him that hath escaped: What Is done?
\p
\v 20 Moab is confounded, because he is overthrown: howl ye, and cry, tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is wasted.
\p
\v 21 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath;
\p
\v 22 And upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, and upon the house of Deblathaim;
\p
\v 23 And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmaon;
\p
\v 24 And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
\p
\v 25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 26 Make him drunk, because he lifted up himself against the Lord; and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
\p
\v 27 For Israel hath been a derision unto thee: as though thou hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words, therefore, which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away captive.
\p
\v 28 Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell in Moab; and be ye Iike the dove, that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole in the highest place.
\p
\v 29 *We have heard the pride of Moab; he is exceedingly proud; his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the loftiness of his heart.
\p
\v 30 I know, saith the Lord, his boasting: and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured to do according as it was able.
\p
\v 31 Therefore will I lament for Moab, and I will cry out to all Moab, for the men of the brick wall that mourn.
\p
\v 32 O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the mourning of Jazer; thy branches are gone over the sea, they are come even to the sea of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest, and thy vintage.
\p
\v 33 *Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses: the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune.
\p
\v 34 From the cry of Hesebon, even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they have uttered their voice; from Segor to Oronaim, as a heifer of three years old; the waters also of Nemrin shall be very bad.
\p
\v 35 And I will take away from Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high places, and that sacrificeth to his gods.
\p
\v 36 Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes; and my heart a sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall; because he hath done more than he could, therefore they have perished.
\p
\v 37 *For every head shall be bald, and every beard shall be shaven: all hands shall be tied together, and upon every back there shall be haircloth.
\p
\v 38 Upon all the house-tops of Moab, and in the streets thereof general mourning; because I have broken Moab as an useless vessel, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 39 How is it overthrown, and they have howled? How hath Moab bowed down the neck, and is confounded? And Moab shall be a derision, and an example to all round about him.
\p
\v 40 Thus saith the Lord: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to Moab.
\p
\v 41 Carioth is taken, and the strong holds are won: and the heart of the valiant men of Moab, in that day, shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.
\p
\v 42 And Moab shall cease to be a people: because he hath gloried against the Lord.
\p
\v 43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare come upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 44 *He that shall flee from the fear, shall fall into the pit; and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 45 They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of Hesebon, but there came a fire out of Hesebon, and a flame out of the midst of Seon, and it shall devour part of Moab, and the crown of the head of the children of tumult.
\p
\v 46 Woe to thee, Moab, thou hast perished, O people of Chamos; for thy sons, and thy daughters are taken captives.
\p
\v 47 And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last days, saith the Lord. Hitherto the judgments of Moab.

\cd The like desolation of Ammon, of Idumea, of the Syrians, of the Agarenes, and of the Elamites.
\p
\v 1 Against *the children of Ammon. Thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath Melchom inherited Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities?
\p
\v 2 Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath, of the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 3 Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath; gird yourselves with haircloth; mourn, and go about by the hedges; for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests and his princes together.
\p
\v 4 Why gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley hath flowed away, O delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said: Who shall come to me?
\p
\v 5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and you shall be scattered every one out of one another's sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that flee.
\p
\v 6 And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 7 Against Edom.* Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Theman? counsel is perished from her children: their wisdom is become unprofitable.
\p
\v 8 Flee, and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye inhabitants of Dedan; for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon him, the time of his visitation.
\p
\v 9 If grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they not have left a bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what was enough for them.
\p
\v 10 But I have made Esau bare, I have revealed his secrets, and he cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren and his neighbours, and he shall not be.
\p
\v 11 Leave thy fatherless children: I will make them live; and thy widows shall hope in thee.
\p
\v 12 For thus saith the Lord: Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup, shall certainly drink; and shalt thou come off as innocent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking thou shalt drink.
\p
\v 13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra shall become a desolation: and a reproach, and a desert, and a curse, and all her cities shall be everlasting wastes.
\p
\v 14 *I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent to the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let us rise up to battle.
\p
\v 15 For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations, despicable among men.
\p
\v 16 Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart; O thou that dwellest in the clifts of the rock, and endeavourest to lay hold on the height of the hill; *but though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as an eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 17 And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.
\p
\v 18 *As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha, and the neighbours thereof, saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no son of man inhabit it.
\p
\v 19 Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the Jordan, against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall abide me? *and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?
\p
\v 20 Therefore, hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken concerning Edom: and his thoughts, which he hath thought concerning the inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the flock shall cast them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation.
\p
\v 21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of their voice is heard in the Red Sea.
\p
\v 22 Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he shall spread his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.
\p
\v 23 Against Damascus. Emath is confounded, and Arphad: for they have heard very bad tidings, they are troubled as in the sea: through care they could not rest.
\p
\v 24 Damascus is undone, she is put to flight, trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour.
\p
\v 25 How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of joy?
\p
\v 26 Therefore, her young men shall fall in her streets: and all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the strong holds of Benadad.
\p
\v 28 Against Cedar, and against the kingdoms of Asor, which Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, destroyed. Thus saith the Lord: Arise, and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the east.
\p
\v 29 They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall carry off for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they shall call fear upon them round about.
\p
\v 30 Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that inhabit Asor, saith the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against you.
\p
\v 31 Arise, and go up to a nation that is at ease, and that dwelleth securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor bars: they dwell alone.
\p
\v 32 And their camels shall be for a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle for a booty: and I will scatter into every wind them that have their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction upon them from all their confines, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 33 And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit it.
\p
\v 34 The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias, the prophet, against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias, king of Juda, saying:
\p
\v 35 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow of Elam, and their chief strength.
\p
\v 36 And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds: and there shall be no nation to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come.
\p
\v 37 And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies, and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, my fierce wrath, saith the Lord: and will send the sword after them, till I consume them.
\p
\v 38 And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy kings and princes from thence, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 39 But in the latter days I will cause the captives of Elam to return, saith the Lord.

\cl Jeremias 50
\cd Babylon, which hath afflicted the Israelites, after their restoration, shall be utterly destroyed.
\p
\v 1 The word *that the Lord hath spoken against Babylon, and against the land of the Chaldeans, in the hand of Jeremias the prophet.
\p
\v 2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish it, lift up a standard: proclaim, and conceal it not: say: Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is overthrown, their graven things are confounded, their idols are overthrown.
\p
\v 3 For a nation is come up against her out of the north, which shall make her land desolate: and there shall be none to dwell therein, from man even to beast: yea, they are removed, and gone away.
\p
\v 4 In these days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together: going and weeping, they shall make haste, and shall seek the Lord their God.
\p
\v 5 They shall ask the way to Sion, their faces are hitherward. They shall come, and shall be joined to the Lord by an everlasting covenant, which shall never be forgotten.
\p
\v 6 My people have been a lost flock, their shepherds have caused them to go astray, and have made them wander in the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting-place.
\p
\v 7 All that found them, have devoured them: and their enemies said: We have not sinned in so doing: because they have sinned against the Lord, the beauty of justice, and against the Lord, the hope of their fathers.
\p
\v 8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans: and be ye as kids at the head of the flock.
\p
\v 9 For behold I raise up, and will bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the north: and they shall be prepared against her, and from thence she shall be taken: their arrows, like those of a mighty man, a destroyer, shall not return in vain.
\p
\v 10 And Chaldea shall be made a prey: all that waste her shall be filled, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 11 Because you rejoice, and speak great things, pillaging my inheritance: because you are spread abroad as calves upon the grass, and have bellowed as bulls.
\p
\v 12 Your mother is confounded exceedingly, and she that bore you is made even with the dust: behold she shall be the last among the nations, a wilderness unpassable, and dry.
\p
\v 13 Because of the wrath of the Lord, it shall not be inhabited, but shall be wholly desolate: every one that shall pass by Babylon, shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
\p
\v 14 Prepare yourselves against Babylon, round about, all you that bend the bow: fight against her, spare not arrows: because she hath sinned against the Lord.
\p
\v 15 Shout against her, she hath everywhere given her hand, her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down, for it is the vengeance of the Lord. Take vengeance upon her: as she hath done, so do to her.
\p
\v 16 Destroy the sower out of Babylon, and him that holdeth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the sword of the dove every man shall return to his people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
\p
\v 17 Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria devoured him: and last this Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, hath broken his bones.
\p
\v 18 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, as I have visited the king of Assyria.
\p
\v 19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation: and he shall feed on Carmel, and Basan, and his soul shall be satisfied in Mount Ephraim, and Galaad.
\p
\v 20 In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none: and the sin of Juda, and there shall none be found: for I will be merciful to them, whom I shall leave.
\p
\v 21 Go up against the land of the rulers, and punish the inhabitants thereof, waste, and destroy all behind them, saith the Lord: and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
\p
\v 22 A noise of war in the land, and a great destruction.
\p
\v 23 How is the hammer of the whole earth broken, and destroyed? how is Babylon turned into a desert among the nations?
\p
\v 24 I have caused thee to fall into a snare, and thou art taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware of it: thou art found and caught, because thou hast provoked the Lord.
\p
\v 25 The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his wrath : for the Lord, the God of hosts, hath a work to be done in the land of the Chaldeans.
\p
\v 26 Come ye against her from the uttermost borders: open, that they may go forth that shall tread her down: take the stones out of the way, and make heaps, and destroy her: and let nothing of her be left.
\p
\v 27 Destroy all her valiant men, let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them, for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
\p
\v 28 The voice of them that flee, and of them that have escaped out of the land of Babylon: to declare in Sion the revenge of the Lord, our God, the revenge of his temple.
\p
\v 29 Declare to many against Babylon, to all that bend the bow: stand together against her round about, and let none escape: pay her according to her work: *according to all that she hath done, do ye to her: for she hath lifted up herself against the Lord, against the holy One of Israel.
\p
\v 30 Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and all her men of war shall hold their peace in that day, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 31 Behold I come against thee, O proud one, saith the Lord, the God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time of thy visitation.
\p
\v 32 And the proud one shall fall, he shall fall down, and there shall be none to lift him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
\p
\v 33 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel, and the children of Juda are oppressed together: all that have taken them captives, hold them fast, they will not let them go.
\p
\v 34 Their Redeemer is strong, the Lord of hosts is his name, he will defend their cause in judgment, to terrify the land, and to disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\p
\v 35 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
\p
\v 36 A sword upon her diviners, and they shall be foolish: a sword upon her valiant ones, and they shall be dismayed.
\p
\v 37 A sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the people that are in the midst of her: and they shall become as women: a sword upon her treasures, and they shall be made a spoil.
\p
\v 38 A drought upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: because it is a land of idols, and they glory in monstrous things.
\p
\v 39 Therefore shall dragons dwell there with the fig-fauns: and ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever, neither shall it be built up from generation to generation.
\p
\v 40 *As the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and their neighbour cities, saith the Lord: no man shall dwell there, neither shall the son of man inhabit it.
\p
\v 41 Behold a people cometh from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall rise from the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 42 They shall take the bow and the shield: they are cruel and unmerciful: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses: like a man prepared for battle against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
\p
\v 43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands are grown feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, pangs as a woman in labour.
\p
\v 44 *Behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan to the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall bear up against me? **and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?
\p
\v 45 Therefore, hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken against Babylon: and his thoughts which he hath thought against the land of the Chaldeans: surely the little ones of the flocks shall pull them down, of a truth their habitation shall be destroyed with them.
\p
\v 46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard amongst the nations.

\f + \fr 50:1\ft Prophet. He had spoken against them in the fourth year of Joachim, and now is more explicit in the fourth of Sedecias, (chap. 51:60.) sending his predictions to be read, and then thrown into the Euphrates. The fall of Babylon was gradual. It was in consequence of her pride and cruelty, ver. 11, 17, 23, 29., and Isaias 47:6. (Calmet) --- It had shewn the greatest enmity to the Jews, and was at last overthrown by the Medes and Persians. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 50:2\ft Declare. This is grand. Let all the captives publish these tidings. (Calmet) --- Bel, etc. Bel and Merodach were worshipped for gods by the men of Babylon. (Challoner) --- Merodach might be an ancient king deified. (Calmet) --- These greatest of their idols could neither save the people nor themselves. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 50:3\ft A nation, etc., viz., the Medes, (Challoner) under Darius, (Daniel 5:31.; Theodoret; Grotius) or rather under Cyrus, who came upon Babylon from the north, after conquering Asia; though he was born to the east of that city, Isaias 61:2, 25. He was a Mede by his mother, and ruler of that nation. He gave liberty to the Jews, as the prophet inculcates ten times. --- Desolate. Herodotus, Xenophon, etc., say not that Cyrus demolished any part of the city; but Berosus informs us that he took it without opposition, and levelled the outer walls. Hystaspes did more damage. (Herodotus 3:150.)\f*
\f + \fr 50:4\ft Weeping for joy and compunction. Israel returns, as well as Juda. (Calmet) --- Thus Joseph wept when he beheld his brethren, Genesis 42:24. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 50:5\ft Covenant. They renewed the old one under Nehemias, and never publicly broke it, as they had done. Yet the covenant of Christ is more properly meant.\f*
\f + \fr 50:6\ft Shepherds; kings, (Calmet) and false prophets. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 50:7\ft Not sinned: the Jews were such notorious offenders. But in what had they injured the Chaldeans? --- Beauty. Hebrew, "dwelling or fold."\f*
\f + \fr 50:8\ft Kids; rams. This comparison was not ignoble. Go boldly out of the city, before it be besieged.\f*
\f + \fr 50:9\ft Nations. Cyrus had Armenians, etc., in his army. (Calmet) --- Thence, by the bed of the Euphrates, the waters of which were mostly let out into the marshes. Thus the city was taken, while the people were feasting. (Herodotus 1:191.) --- Aristotle (Pol. 3:3.) says, three days passed before all the citizens were apprised of its fate, it was so extensive: but this is incredible. If we follow the account of Berosus, Cyrus routed Nabonides, who fled to Borsippe, while he took Babylon and demolished the outer walls. (Josephus, contra Apion i.) (Calmet) --- North, with respect to Babylon. (Worthington) --- The Persians lay rather to the south, and to the east of Palestine, (Haydock) if our maps be accurate. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 50:11\ft Bulls. You have rioted in Juda, and treated my people cruelly. (Haydock) --- In Hebrew four verbs have improperly i for v; but [in] Jeremias 51:34., v supplants i five times. (Kennicott)\f*
\f + \fr 50:12\ft Dust, like a suppliant, Isaias 47:1. (Calmet) --- Dry. The country shall be equally unfruitful. The waters of the Euphrates being let off, gave a passage to the enemy, ver. 9. (Haydock) --- Babylon soon lost its splendour. (Calmet) --- Vologeses completed its ruin. (Pliny, [Natural History?] 6:26.) --- It ceased to be the metropolis or mother city. (Haydock) --- The whole country was laid waste. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 50:15\ft Hand, to form leagues; or she faints, (Septuagint) and submits, Lamentations 5:6.\f*
\f + \fr 50:16\ft Harvest. Such were usually unmolested. (Calmet) --- Babylon was so large, that people sowed corn within the walls. (Curt. v.) --- The environs were well cultivated. (Pliny, [Natural History?] 18:17.) --- Dove, or the destroyer; for the Hebrew word signifies either the one or the other. (Challoner) (Chap. 25:38., and 46:16.) --- Literally, "from before the sword of the dove." The power of Babylon is no more. (Haydock) --- The king is compared to a dove, for his swiftness; or God is meek, though terrible. (Worthington) --- Land. The other nations were set free as well as the Jews. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 50:17\ft Bones. He completely ruined the nation, which the Assyrians had left. (Haydock) --- They led the ten tribes away, and the Chaldeans took the rest, 4 Kings xviii., and xxv. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 50:18\ft Assyria. This monarchy was subdued by Nabopolasser.\f*
\f + \fr 50:19\ft Israel; the ten tribes, whose country is specified.\f*
\f + \fr 50:20\ft None. Idolatry shall not be re-established.\f*
\f + \fr 50:21\ft Rulers: the most potent empire of Babylon. --- All. Hebrew, "anathematize them and their posterity."\f*
\f + \fr 50:23\ft Hammer. The violent injustice of the Chaldeans is thus entitled.\f*
\f + \fr 50:24\ft Aware. Men seemed to rise out of the earth, ver. 9.\f*
\f + \fr 50:25\ft Armoury. Fire and war are the Lord's weapons, Job 38:22. --- Work: punishment, Jeremias 48:10.\f*
\f + \fr 50:26\ft That. Hebrew, "her granaries; trample on her as on heaps of corn, destroy," etc. He alludes to the custom of oxen trampling out the corn, Jeremias 51:33.\f*
\f + \fr 50:28\ft Voice. I hear the captives proclaiming this at their return.\f*
\f + \fr 50:30\ft Peace, in the grave; (Calmet) or shall submit quietly, 1 Machabees 1:3. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 50:31\ft Proud. So the Chaldeans are often styled in the Psalms. (Calmet) --- The prophet addresses Nabuchodonosor, or rather Baltassar, (Menochius) under whom the city was taken, (Josephus, etc.) by Darius and Cyrus. He may be the Nabonides of Berosus, the question is so much perplexed. Yet "we are convinced that Darius reigned at Babylon before Cyrus, and took the city after the death of Baltassar." (Calmet) --- Most commentators are of a different opinion. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 50:33\ft Israel. Samaria had been destroyed forty-four years before the fourth of Joakim, from which period many of Juda had been captives seventy years, till Cyrus became their deliverer, and chastised the Chaldeans. (Calmet) --- Both kingdoms had been oppressed by a strong hand, till a stronger, even God himself, delivered them. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 50:34\ft Name. He gives victory to Cyrus. Thus the Lord directs all for the sake of his elect, and laughs at the vain projects of men. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 50:35\ft Wise men. They were styled Chaldeans, and inhabited a certain part of the city, being employed in astronomical and mathematical observations. They disapproved of those who cast nativities. (Strabo xvi.)\f*
\f + \fr 50:36\ft Diviners. Hebrew, "impostors." They were nowhere more plentiful, Daniel 1:20. Fortune-tellers were consulted on every occasion. The eastern nations are still much addicted to this superstition.\f*
\f + \fr 50:38\ft Drought. Cyrus almost drained the Euphrates, Jeremias 51:42., and Isaias xxi. --- Things, fit to terrify children, Baruch 6:14. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "they are made upon their idols." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 50:39\ft Fig-fauns. Monsters of the desert, or demons in monstrous shapes; such as the ancients called fauns and satyrs: and as they imagined them to live upon wild figs, they called them fauni-ficarii, or fig-fauns. (Challoner) --- Maldonat reads sicariis, "ruffians." Sixtus V and St. Jerome, (in Isaias 13:21.) have fatuis, "foolish wild men." Hebrew, "the Tsiim with the iim shall dwell there, and the daughters of the Yahana (Haydock; swans) shall there reside," or "fishermen among the rushes shall dwell," etc. --- Ever. Its situation is unknown. There is still a town of the same name, but not in the same place.\f*
\f + \fr 50:42\ft Cruel. The Medes will not spare for money, ver. 3., and Isaias 13:7.\f*
\f + \fr 50:43\ft King. Baltassar, (though he was succeeded by Darius) or Nabonides, ver. 31. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 50:44\ft And beautiful. Hebrew, "habitation." (Haydock) --- He will rush into the fold, Jeremias 49:19. (Calmet) --- The king of Babylon had ruined many. Others shall destroy him, rushing on like the Jordan. (Worthington)\f*

\cd The miseries that shall fall upon Babylon, from the Medes: the destruction of her idols.
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the Lord: *Behold I will raise up as it were a pestilential wind against Babylon, and against the inhabitants thereof, who have lifted up their heart against me.
\p
\v 2 And I will send to Babylon fanners, and they shall fan her, and shall destroy her land: for they are come upon her on every side in the day of her affliction.
\p
\v 3 Let not him that bendeth, bend his bow, and let not him go up that is armed with a coat of mail: spare not her young men, destroy all her army.
\p
\v 4 And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and the wounded in the regions thereof.
\p
\v 5 For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken by their God, the Lord of hosts: but their land hath been filled with sin against the holy One of Israel.
\p
\v 6 Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, and let every one save his own life: be not silent upon her iniquity: for it is the time of revenge from the Lord, he will render unto her what she hath deserved.
\p
\v 7 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, that made all the earth drunk: the nations have drunk of her wine, and therefore they have staggered.
\p
\v 8 *Babylon is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howl for her, take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.
\p
\v 9 We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed: let us forsake her, and let us go every man to his own land: because her judgment hath reached even to the heavens, and is lifted up to the clouds.
\p
\v 10 The Lord hath brought forth our justices: come, and let us declare in Sion the work of the Lord our God.
\p
\v 11 Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers: the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: and his mind is against Babylon, to destroy it, because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his temple.
\p
\v 12 Upon the walls of Babylon set up the standard, strengthen the watch: set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord hath both purposed, and done all that he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
\p
\v 13 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, rich in treasures, thy end is come for thy entire destruction.
\p
\v 14 *The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying: I will fill thee with men as with locusts, and they shall lift up a joyful shout against thee.
\p
\v 15 *He that made the earth by his power, that hath prepared the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
\p
\v 16 When he uttereth his voice the waters are multiplied in heaven: he lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth; he hath turned lightning into rain; and hath brought forth the wind out of his treasures.
\p
\v 17 Every man is become foolish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by his idol, for what he hath cast is a lie, and there is no breath in them.
\p
\v 18 They are vain works, and worthy to be laughed at; in the time of their visitation, they shall perish.
\p
\v 19 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he that made all things, he it is, and Israel is the sceptre of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.
\p
\v 20 Thou dashest together for me the weapons of war, and with thee I will dash nations together, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms:
\p
\v 21 And with thee I will break in pieces the horse, and his rider: and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot, and him that getteth up into it.
\p
\v 22 And with thee I will break in pieces man and woman, and with thee I will break in pieces the old man and the child, and with thee I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin:
\p
\v 23 And with thee I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock, and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen, and with thee I will break in pieces captains and rulers.
\p
\v 24 And I will render to Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Sion, before your eyes, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Behold I come against thee, thou destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which corruptest the whole earth: and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
\p
\v 26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for the corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for ever, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 27 Set ye up a standard in the land; sound with a trumpet among the nations; prepare the nations against her; call together against her the kings of Ararat, Menni, and Ascenez: number Taphsar against her; bring the horse as the stinging locust.
\p
\v 28 Prepare the nations against her, the kings of Media, their captains, and all the rulers, and all the land of their dominion.
\p
\v 29 And the land shall be in a commotion, and shall be troubled; for the design of the Lord against Babylon shall awake, to make the land of Babylon desert and uninhabitable.
\p
\v 30 The valiant men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have dwelt in holds: their strength hath failed, and they are become as women; her dwelling places are burnt, her bars are broken.
\p
\v 31 One running post shall meet another, and messenger shall meet messenger, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken from one end to the other:
\p
\v 32 And that the fords are taken, and the marshes are burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.
\p
\v 33 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a thrashing-floor; this is the time of her thrashing: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
\p
\v 34 Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, hath eaten me up, he hath devoured me; he hath made me as an empty vessel; he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicate meats, and he hath cast me out.
\p
\v 35 The wrong done to me, and my flesh, be upon Babylon, saith the habitation of Sion; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, saith Jerusalem.
\p
\v 36 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will judge thy cause, and will take vengeance for thee, and I will make her sea desolate, *and will dry up her spring.
\p
\v 37 And Babylon shall be reduced to heaps, a dwelling-place for dragons, an astonishment and a hissing, because there is no inhabitant.
\p
\v 38 They shall roar together like lions, they shall shake their manes like young lions.
\p
\v 39 In their heat I will set them drink; and I will make them drunk, *that they may slumber, and sleep an everlasting sleep, and awake no more, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, and like rams with kids.
\p
\v 41 How is Sesach taken, and the renowned one of all the earth surprised? How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations?
\p
\v 42 The sea is come up over Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
\p
\v 43 Her cities are become an astonishment, a land uninhabited and desolate, a land wherein none can dwell, nor son of man pass through it.
\p
\v 44 And I will visit against Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down: and the nations shall no more flow together to him, for the wall also of Babylon shall fall.
\p
\v 45 Go out of the midst of her, my people; that every man may save his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord.
\p
\v 46 And lest your hearts faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land: and a rumour shall come in one year, and after this year another rumour: and iniquity in the land, and ruler upon ruler.
\p
\v 47 Therefore, behold the days come, and I will visit the idols of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
\p
\v 48 And the heavens and the earth, and all things that are in them shall give praise for Babylon: for spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 49 And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in Israel; so of Babylon there shall fall slain in all the earth.
\p
\v 50 You that have escaped the sword, come away, stand not still; remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\p
\v 51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; shame hath covered our faces; because strangers are come upon the sanctuary of the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 52 Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit her graven things, and in all her land the wounded shall groan.
\p
\v 53 If Babylon should mount up to heaven, and establish her strength on high; from me there should come spoilers upon her, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 54 The noise of a cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
\p
\v 55 Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste, and destroyed out of her the great voice; and their wave shall roar like many waters; their voice hath made a noise:
\p
\v 56 Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon Babylon, and her valiant men are taken, and their bow is weakened, because the Lord, who is a strong revenger, will surely repay.
\p
\v 57 And I will make her princes drunk, and her wise men, and her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men; and they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the king, whose name is Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 58 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: That broad wall of Babylon shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and of the nations shall go to the fire and shall perish.
\p
\v 59 The word that Jeremias, the prophet, commanded Saraias, the son of Nerias, the son of Naasias, when he went with king Sedecias, to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief over the prophecy.
\p
\v 60 And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon Babylon: all these words that are written against Babylon.
\p
\v 61 And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,
\p
\v 62 Thou shalt say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it; so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.
\p
\v 63 And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the midst of the Euphrates:
\p
\v 64 And thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and she shall not rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her, and she shall be utterly destroyed. Thus far are the words of Jeremias.

\f + \fr 51:1\ft Thereof. Hebrew leb kamai, "of the heart, rising up against me." (Haydock) --- Many take Leb-kamai to be the enigmatical name of the Chaldeans, by a secret combination of letters, (Kimchi; Grotius) as if they were not clearly designated in the sequel. (Calmet) --- The prophet expresses more pointedly what he had declared in the preceding chapter. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 51:2\ft Fan her. After the corn was trodden out, it was heaved into the wind. This custom would insinuate the distress and captivity of the Chaldeans.

\f + \fr 51:3\ft Mail. There will be little or no resistance made, Jeremias 50:3. (Haydock) --- The Persians denounce destruction to all taken in arms; or, according to Septuagint and Syriac they exhort each other to fight. (Calmet) --- "Let him," etc. (Haydock) --- Hebrew of the Masorets, "you who bend....spare not." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow," etc. (Haydock) --- Hebrew is printed ne tendat tendat tendans. The second word is properly omitted in some manuscripts. Thus (1 Chronicles 24:6.) we read taken taken, achuz having been put erroneously for achad, one. (Kennicott)\f*
\f + \fr 51:5\ft Forsaken, as a widow, viduatus. (Haydock) --- God still considers the nation as his spouse. --- Their land. That of the Chaldeans, (Calmet) or of the Jews. (Theodoret) --- Sin, or punishment.\f*
\f + \fr 51:6\ft Silent. Jews proclaim that Babylon is justly punished, (Calmet) lest you partake in her crimes, Apocalypse 18:4. Protestants, "be not cut off in her," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:7\ft Cup. She has exercised the vengeance of the Lord on Juda, Egypt, etc.\f*

\f + \fr 51:9\ft We. The guardian angels, or Jews reply. Miracles are lost on her. --- Heavens. Her crimes call for punishment, Genesis 18:21., and Jonas 1:2.\f*
\f + \fr 51:10\ft Justices. We had not injured the Chaldeans, though we had offended God.\f*
\f + \fr 51:11\ft Sharpen. He addresses ironically the citizens of Babylon. --- Medes. Thus the subjects of the Persian monarchs are commonly styled. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 51:12\ft Standard. Call together thy subjects and allies. (Haydock) --- This must be explained of Babylon. (Menochius) --- Yet all will be in vain, ver. 11. (Haydock) --- Ambushes. Herein the valour and genius of heroes was most displayed, Josue 8:2. (Homer)\f*
\f + \fr 51:13\ft Waters. Not far from the Tigris, and divided into two parts by the Euphrates. (Calmet) --- Entire, being cut up by the roots, pedalis, (Lyranus) or according to the measure of thy crimes. (Delrio) (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "thy end is truly come into thy bowels." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:14\ft Himself. Septuagint, "his hand" lifted up, or by his power. --- Locusts. Their ravages were equally dreaded, Joel 2:4., and Judges 6:5.\f*
\f + \fr 51:16\ft Rain. Thunder and lightning are usually followed by showers. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 51:17\ft Every man, etc. That is, every maker of idols, however he boasts of his knowledge and skill, does but shew himself a fool in pretending to make a god. (Challoner) (Wisdom 14:18.) --- By his, or "by default of knowledge;" (a scientia. Haydock) as the Hebrew may also mean. The Babylonians were so confounded, they knew not what to do. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "Every man is brutish by his knowledge." Marginal note, or "is more brutish than to know," Jeremias 10:14. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:20\ft Thou, Cyrus, (Grotius) or more commonly the Chaldeans are understood.\f*
\f + \fr 51:25\ft Mountain. So Babylon is styled in derision. See Jeremias 21:13., and Isaias 1:10., and 20:6., and 22:1. The city stood on a plain. Some think that its palace and walls are designated. --- Burnt; unfruitful. This happened long after Cyrus, though it then ceased to be the capital, and became only a shadow of its former greatness.\f*

\f + \fr 51:27\ft Prepare. Literally, "sanctify." (Haydock) --- Call together all nations to fight against Babylon. (Worthington) --- Many religious ceremonies were used. --- Ararat, where the ark rested, (Genesis 8:4.) near the Araxes, (St. Jerome, in Isaias xxxvii.) or in the Gordyean mountains, in Armenia, where the Menni dwelt. --- Ascenez, or Ascantes, (Calmet) near the Tanais. (Pliny, [Natural History?] 6:7.) --- Taphsar, "the prince," Nahum 3:17. (Pagnin) "Warriors." (Chaldean) "Machines" (Septuagint) --- Caterpillar, or "locust," (bruchum. Haydock) which resembles more a body of cavalry. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Push forward the cavalry against her, as a multitude of locusts." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:28\ft Prepare; "sanctify." (Haydock) --- Media. Cyrus, ver. 11. --- Captains: generals. (Calmet) --- Rulers. Literally, "magistrates." (Haydock) --- Hebrew Seganim, a title used once by Isaias, and frequently by those who wrote after the Assyrians (Calmet) commenced their invasion. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:30\ft Bars, fastening the gates. (Calmet) --- Those who entered by the channel of the river, would seize the gates to let their companions enter. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:31\ft King, feasting in his palace, (Herodotus 1:191.) or at Borsippe. (Berosus) He sent to make inquiries, (Calmet) or his subjects hastened to convey the doleful tidings, and thus met each other. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:32\ft Fords. Thus the enemy entered. --- Marches. Hebrew, "sedges," which grew to the size of trees, and were burnt when the waters of the river and lakes were drained. Herodotus (I. 185, 178.) specifies a lake four hundred and twenty stadia square, and says the ditches round the city were full of water.\f*
\f + \fr 51:33\ft Threshing, performed by oxen treading, and by rollers, etc., Judges 8:16., and 2 Kings 12:31. --- Little; about fifty-six years.\f*
\f + \fr 51:34\ft Dragon, or huge fish, which swallows without chewing. Sion is here venting her complaint, Psalm 136:8. (Calmet) --- She shews that Babylon is justly punished for her cruelty towards God's people. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 51:36\ft Spring; commerce, the source of her riches; or rather the waters shall be brought out of their usual channels. For many ages (Calmet) the Euphrates has been lost in sands, and reaches not the Persian Gulf. (Pliny, [Natural History?] 7:27.) (Cellar. 3:16.)\f*
\f + \fr 51:37\ft Dragons. This has been the case for above sixteen centuries, Jeremias 50:31., and Isaias 13:21.\f*
\f + \fr 51:38\ft Roar. They shall retain their haughty air and threaten others, when they themselves shall fall (Calmet) in the midst of their feasting, Daniel 5:30. (Xenophon vii.)\f*
\f + \fr 51:41\ft Sesach, the city which worshipped the moon, (chap. 25:26.) Bel, (chap. 50:2.) etc.\f*
\f + \fr 51:42\ft Sea: numerous armies of Cyrus, or the waters of the Euphrates let loose. (Calmet) --- In the days of Alexander [the Great], many tombs of the kings were inundated. (Strabo xv.)\f*
\f + \fr 51:44\ft Down. His priests pretended that he eat, (Daniel 14:11.) and a woman of their choice slept in the most retired part of the temple. (Herodotus 1:181.) --- The prophet derides this notion. The idol, or rather his votaries, (Haydock) shall be forced to let go the Israelites. (Calmet) --- Fall, by means of Cyrus and of Darius, Jeremias 50:3. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 51:46\ft Faint. You may apprehend that your miseries will increase in the midst of such confusion; but no, Baltassar, the last of your oppressor's race, shall be assassinated by Neriglissor, who will be succeeded by Laborosoarchod and Nabonides. This last shall yield to Cyrus, who will grant you liberty. Baltassar reigned two years, Neriglissor four, his ill-tempered infant son nine months, when his followers murdered him, and gave the crown to a Babylonian called Nabonides, who kept it seventeen years, till Cyrus took him prisoner. This we learn from Berosus, quoted by Josephus, contra Apion 1:On the other hand Daniel makes Darius, the Mede, succeed Baltassar, and after him Cyrus reigned. To these changes and continual alarms the prophet alludes.\f*
\f + \fr 51:47\ft Idols; Bel, etc., ver. 41. --- Slain. Hebrew, "dancers." The people were feasting. (Calmet) --- It means also "slain," (Protestants) or "soldiers."\f*
\f + \fr 51:48\ft Praise, for the just punishment. (Haydock) --- The crimes were public. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 51:50\ft Mind. Offer sacrifices of thanks on Sion, (Haydock) both Jews and other nations. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 51:51\ft We. The Jews answer: we are ashamed when we think of these places. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 51:53\ft High. Her fortifications and ditches will prove fruitless, Jeremias 48:7, 18.\f*
\f + \fr 51:55\ft Great voice, or boasting and songs of joy, usual at public meetings. --- Noise. They groan under affliction.\f*
\f + \fr 51:57\ft Drunk, with the wine of fury, ver. 39., and Jeremias 25:26.\f*
\f + \fr 51:58\ft Broad wall. The pagan historians agree not in the dimensions, but allow it was excessively broad and lofty. (Calmet) --- Six chariots might go abreast. It was 360 stadia long, (Ctesias); or 480 (Herodotus 1:178.) that is above 23 leagues, allowing 2,500 paces for each. This author says the breadth was fifty cubits of the king, three inches larger than the common one, or about twenty-one inches. Pliny ([Natural History?] 6:26.) improperly applies this to Roman feet, and says the walls were two hundred feet high; while Herodotus assigns so many cubits. (Calmet) --- There were three different walls. (Curt. v.) --- Cyrus demolished the outer one. (Berosus) --- What remained, (Calmet) with the hundred brazen gates, Darius treated in like manner. (Herodotus 1:179., and 3:159.) --- Thus was the prediction fulfilled, and the works of so many captive nations brought to nothing. It is asserted that 200,000 (Calmet) daily finished a stadium, (Curt. v.) or 125 paces. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 51:59\ft With. Hebrew also, (Calmet) "on behalf of." (Protestant marginal note) (Haydock) --- It is no where else asserted that Sedecias went in person, and Septuagint, Chaldean, etc., explain it in this manner. Baruch accompanied his brother Saraias, and probably took the letter, Baruch 1:2. Saraias went to petition for the sacred vessels. --- Prophecy, or of the embassy to speak (Calmet) in the king's name. Hebrew menucha, was a caution of Benjamin. It means, "rest;" whence some have inferred that he was chamberlain, (Canticle of Canticles 3:8.) or a favourite. Most translate, "chief of the presents," Septuagint and Chaldean, as if they they had read mincha, which he carried as a tribute to Babylon. Jeremias gave him charge of the parcel, perhaps before Baruch had determined to go.\f*
\f + \fr 51:64\ft Sink. The angel did the like; (Apocalypse 18:21.; Calmet) and the Phoceans, leaving their country, swore that they would return no more till a piece of red hot iron, which they threw into the sea, should swim. (Herodotus 1:165.) --- Thus, etc., was added by the compiler. Septuagint omit the sentence, as what relates to Babylon is placed [in] Jeremias 28. in their copies. (Calmet) --- Yet Grabe puts it in a different character. (Haydock) --- Jeremias wrote a great deal, after the 4th year of Sedecias, ver. 59. (Calmet) --- He here finished his predictions against Babylon. (Worthington) --- This does not mean that he did not write the next chapter, (Menochius) as Cappel allows, (Houbigant) though this may still be doubted. (Haydock)\f*

\cl Jeremias 52
\cd A recapitulation of the reign of Sedecias, and the destruction of Jerusalem. The number of the captives.
\p
\v 1 Sedecias *was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobna.
\p
\v 2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.
\p
\v 3 For the wrath of the Lord was against Jerusalem, and against Juda, till he cast them out from his presence; and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 4 *And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it, and built forts against it round about.
\p
\v 5 And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedecias.
\p
\v 6 And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a famine overpowered the city; and there was no food for the people of the land.
\p
\v 7 And the city was broken up, and the men of war fled, and went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two walls, and leadeth to the king's garden, (the Chaldeans besieging the city round about) and they went by the way that leadeth to the wilderness.
\p
\v 8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king; and they overtook Sedecias in the desert which is near Jericho: and all his companions were scattered from him.
\p
\v 9 And when they had taken the king, they carried him to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath; and he gave judgment upon him.
\p
\v 10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias before his eyes; and he slew all the princes of Juda, in Reblatha.
\p
\v 11 And he put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him into Babylon, and he put him in prison till the day of his death.
\p
\v 12 And in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan, the general of the army, who stood before the king of Babylon, in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 13 And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt with fire.
\p
\v 14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the general, broke down all the wall of Jerusalem, round about.
\p
\v 15 But Nabuzardan, the general, carried away captives some of the poor people, and of the rest of the common sort, who remained in the city, and of the fugitives that were fled over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
\p
\v 16 But of the poor of the land, Nabuzardan, the general, left some for vine-dressers, and for husbandmen.
\p
\v 17 The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass that was in the house of the Lord: and they carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\p
\v 18 And they took the cauldrons, and the flesh-hooks, and the psalteries, and the bowls, and the little mortars, and all the brazen vessels that had been used in the ministry: and
\p
\v 19 The general took away the pitchers, and the censers, and the pots, and the basins, and the candlesticks, and the mortars, and the cups; as many as were of gold, in gold; and as many as were of silver, in silver:
\p
\v 20 And the two pillars, and one sea, and twelve oxen of brass that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all these vessels.
\p
\v 21 And concerning the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high, and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about; but the thickness thereof was four fingers, and it was hollow within.
\p
\v 22 And chaptrels of brass were upon both: and the height of one chaptrel was five cubits; and net-work, and pomegranates were upon the chaptrels round about, all of brass. The same of the second pillar, and the pomegranates.
\p
\v 23 And there were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down; and the pomegranates, being a hundred in all, were compassed with net-work.
\p
\v 24 And the general took Saraias the chief priest, and Sophonias, the second priest, and the three keepers of the entry.
\p
\v 25 He also took out of the city, one eunuch, that was chief over the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, that were found in the city; and a scribe, an officer of the army, who exercised the young soldiers; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
\p
\v 26 And Nabuzardan, the general, took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.
\p
\v 27 And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death, in Reblatha, in the land of Emath: and Juda was carried away captive out of his land.
\p
\v 28 This is the people whom Nabuchodonosor carried away captive: In the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.
\p
\v 29 In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, eight hundred and thirty-two souls from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 30 In the three and twentieth year of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuzardan, the general, carried away of the Jews, seven hundred and forty-five souls. So all the souls were four thousand six hundred.
\p
\v 31 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth *year of the captivity of Joachin, king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Joachin, king of Juda, and brought him forth out of prison.
\p
\v 32 And he spoke kindly to him, and he set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon.
\p
\v 33 And he changed his prison-garments, and he eat bread before him always all the days of his life.
\p
\v 34 And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.

\f + \fr 52:1\ft Sedecias. This is purely historical, taken from 4 Kings 24:18., etc. Many doubt with reason the Jeremias inserted it, as he could not well be alive at the time when Joakim was honoured, ver. 31. If he had written both this and the Book of Kings, the variations which we here discover would not be seen. It seems, therefore, that Esdras or some other has inserted it, to explain the fall of Jerusalem and the lamentations; as a similar addition has been made to Isaias, Jeremias 36., etc. See Grotius.

\f + \fr 52:12\ft Tenth: 4 Kings seventh, on which day Nabuzardan set out from Reblatha, according to some. But it was above sixty leagues, or hours journey, distant.

\f + \fr 52:15\ft Poor. He took those of the city, and left the poor of the country, ver. 16. (Calmet) --- Alexandrian Septuagint omits this verse, which Grabe inserts: 16. "And the rest of the people, the chief cook or general, left for," etc. (Haydock)\f*

\f + \fr 52:28\ft Seventh year of Nabuchodonosor, and last of Joakim, 4 Kings. Roman Septuagint omits this and the next verse, which are found in Theodoret and the Complutensian edition. (Calmet) --- Grabe supplies all from, And Juda, ver 27, to 31. (Haydock) --- Zuinglius observes that the Septuagint have not a fragment of it, and that it has been added by some one to hide the ignominy of the Jews. It is interpolated in the Arabic of the Lond. Polyglot, and seems contrary to the true history, 4 Kings 24:14. (Kennicott, Diss. 2.)\f*
\f + \fr 52:31\ft Joachin. He had been thrown into prison when 18 years old, and continued there 37 years. It is not probable that Jeremias wrote this. Evilmerodach had also been the same in prison. --- Five: 4 Kings has seven. Probably Nabuchodonosor died on the 25th, and his son then resolved to liberate Joachin; which he did on the 27th.\f*
