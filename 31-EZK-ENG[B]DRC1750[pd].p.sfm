\imt1 THE PROPHECY OF EZECHIEL.
\im Ezechiel, whose name signifies the strength of God, was of the priestly race, and of the number of the captives that were carried away to Babylon with king Joachin. He was contemporary with Jeremias, and prophesied to the same effect in Babylon as Jeremias did in Jerusalem; and is said to have ended his days in like manner, by martyrdom. (Challoner) --- He strove to comfort the captives, who began to repine that they had listened too readily to Jeremias, exhorting them to submit to the king of Babylon. Some think that part of his prophecies is lost, as Josephus mentions two books: but the nine last chapters, regarding the new city and temple, might form the second division. The Jews hesitated whether to allow his works to be canonical, as they seemed to differ from Moses, and from the dimensions given of Solomon's temple. But the same God might surely suggest some improvements, and the morality of the prophet is most excellent. (Calmet) --- His style may be compared to that of Homer (Grotius) and Alcaeus. Many have thought that (Calmet) Pythagoras was his disciple; (Eusebius, praep. xiii.) yet the latter seems to have lived after the prophet, who was led into captivity with Jechonias, the year of the world 3410, and prophesied twenty years. He dates from this period, (Calmet) and from the renewal of the covenant under Josias, (chap. 1:1.; Haydock) when the captivity was first announced. (Worthington) --- The Jews allowed none to read the first and the nine (Haydock) last chapters, nor the beginning of Genesis, nor the Canticle of Canticles, before they were thirty years old; and they never attempted to explain the vision nor the building of the temple, supposing it to be above the power of man. (St. Jerome)

\cl Ezechiel 1
\cd The time of Ezechiel's prophecy: he sees a glorious vision.
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, *in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the captives, **by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of God.
\p
\v 2 On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin,
\p
\v 3 The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel, the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar: and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.
\p
\v 4 And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north: and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it: and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber:
\p
\v 5 And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures: and this was their appearance: there was the likeness of a man in them.
\p
\v 6 Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.
\p
\v 7 Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.
\p
\v 8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they had faces, and wings on the four sides.
\p
\v 9 And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another. They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.
\p
\v 10 And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.
\p
\v 11 And their faces, and their wings, were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:
\p
\v 12 And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.
\p
\v 13 And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.
\p
\v 14 And the living creatures ran, and returned like flashes of lightning.
\p
\v 15 Now, as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.
\p
\v 16 And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them, was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.
\p
\v 17 When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went.
\p
\v 18 The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: *and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.
\p
\v 19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.
\p
\v 20 Whithersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
\p
\v 21 When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up together, and followed them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
\p
\v 22 And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, as the appearance of crystal, terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.
\p
\v 23 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.
\p
\v 24 And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.
\p
\v 25 For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.
\p
\v 26 And above the firmament, that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire-stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was a likeness as of the appearance of a man above upon it.
\p
\v 27 And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber, as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.
\p
\v 28 As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about.

\f + \fr 1:1\ft And is either superfluous, as at the beginning of most of the sacred books, (Calmet) or shews the connection of what is written with what the prophet saw or heard internally. (St. Augustine, in Psalm iv.; St. Gregory) (Worthington) --- Year: either of the age of Ezechiel, or (as others will have it) from the solemn covenant made in the eighteenth year of Josias; (4 Kings xxiii.; Challoner; Worthington; Calmet) or he alludes to the era of Nabopolassur, used at Babylon, (Menochius) or to the last jubilee. See Sanctius. The thirtieth year, from the prediction of Holda to Josias, (Haydock) concurs with the fifth of the prophet's captivity, Ezechiel 17:12. (Usher, the year of the world 3410.) --- Fourth of the sacred year, (Calmet) on Friday, 24th July, (Usher) or in January. (St. Jerome) --- Chobar, or Aboras, which runs westward into the Euphrates, above Thapsacus. (Strabo) --- The captives were in those parts, though not present. (Calmet) --- Opened, in spirit, (Haydock) by faith. (St. Jerome) --- The prophet fell prostrate, Ezechiel 2:1. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:2\ft Captivity. Literally, "transmigration," (Haydock) which is more agreeable to the Hebrew, etc. Jechonias delivered himself up. Six years after this, Sedecias was taken. (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 1:3\ft Hand; power, energy of the Holy Spirit. (Theodoret)\f*
\f + \fr 1:4\ft North, denoting the invasion of Judea by the Chaldeans, Isaias 14:31. (Sanctius) --- The Jews thought the following vision inexplicable, and deliberated about rejecting the book, when Ananias offered to answer every difficulty. They assigned him three hundred barrels of oil to light his lamp, while he performed the task. (Rabbins) --- This hyperbole shews their idea of its obscurity. (Calmet) --- Amber, (electri) a compound of four parts of gold and one of silver, (Pliny, [Natural History?] 33:4.) more precious than either. (St. Jerome) --- It may also mean orichalchum, or a mixture of gold and brass, (Bochart, anim. 2 b. 6:16.) which was also preferred before gold alone, as it had the hardness of brass. (Lucret. Serv. in xii. Aeneid.) -----alboque orichalcho Circumdat loricam humeris. --- Two vessels are mentioned, probably of this composition, 1 Esdras 8:27. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:5\ft Living creatures. Cherubims, (as appears from Ecclesiasticus 49:10.) represented to the prophet under these mysterious shapes, as supporting the throne of God, and as it were drawing his chariot. All this chapter appeared so obscure and full of mysteries to the ancient Hebrews, that, as we learn from St. Jerome, (ep. ad Paulin.) they suffered none to read it before they were thirty years old. (Challoner) --- The pagans had many such compound figures as are here represented. (Parkhurst, p. 411.) (Haydock) --- Sanchoniathon (apud Eusebius, praep. 2.) seems to have borrowed his description from this place. --- In them. They stood upright, and had some parts of the human figure. (Calmet) --- Indeed, it seems to have been predominant. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:6\ft Faces. This sometimes means shapes; and Pererius supposes that the animal had the head of a man, and the breast covered with lions' hair, the feet or round cloven hoofs of an ox, and the wings of an eagle. But it had rather four faces as well as wings, the faces of the man and lion being to the right, and the other two to the left; (Calmet; Tirinus) or the eagle was behind (Haydock) or above the head of the man, and the lion and ox at his right and left. (Cornelius a Lapide) (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 1:7\ft Straight. Hebrew, "a straight foot." Protestants prefer "feet." (Haydock) --- Of a calf. Aquila reads to the same import hagol, "round," instead of hegel, (Haydock) "a calf." Symmachus has "winged feet," like Mercury. (Calmet) --- Septuagint omit this, says St. Jerome, though we have his version of Symmachus as if it belonged to the Septuagint; and it occurs in Grabe as genuine. --- Brass. Septuagint add, "and their feathers were very light." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:8\ft Wings. Their arms were covered with feathers, and the hand appeared at the extremity; or they had four arms under the wings, Ezechiel 10:8. They all came from the shoulders, so as to correspond with the four faced animal, ver. 6. (Calmet) --- Others believe that each face had four wings, so that the animal would have sixteen. (Maldonat) --- In Isaias 9:2., the cherub has six wings. The form was variable, as there was nothing in nature similar. They were perhaps designed to represent the eternity and dominion of God over the whole creation, ver. 28. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:9\ft Another. Two above were extended so as to support the throne, which seemed to rest on these eight wings connected together. The others were joined so as perfectly to cover what was below the breast. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "And the wings of those four were touching each other, and their faces (Calmet reads with Chaldean and Hebrew, wings) turned not," etc. (Haydock) --- The wings did not imitate those of birds, going to and fro, but were constantly in the same direction; or the animals did not change their respective situations: as they had four faces, there was always one of them turned to the opposite quarters of the world. (Calmet) --- They turned not about, (ver. 12.) but having faces on every side, were ready to go any way. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 1:10\ft Over. This is not specified in Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, or St. Jerome. (Calmet) --- "The face of an eagle for all the four." It must have been above or behind the man, as the situation of the other two faces is here determined, ver. 6. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:11\ft Faces. Septuagint, "wings:" and indeed it does not appear how their faces were stretched upwards, (Calmet) unless they looked earnestly that way; though, out of respect, they covered their faces with two wings.\f*
\f + \fr 1:14\ft Flashes. Hebrew Bazak. (Haydock) --- Theodotion retains the original. His version seems to have been inserted in the Septuagint, (Calmet) who omitted this verse, as seeming to contradict ver. 9., and 12. (St. Jerome) --- Yet it only signifies that the motion was quick as lightning, though they did not alter their situation with respect to each other.\f*
\f + \fr 1:15\ft Faces. One wheel crossed another at right angles, so that it was ready to move in any direction, (ver. 17.; Calmet) like a globe. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:16\ft Sea; sky blue. Hebrew, "Tharsis," which Symmachus renders "the hyacinth;" a precious stone, Exodus 28:20. (Calmet) --- Midst. The evangelists and New Testament agree perfectly with the Old. (St. Gregory, hom. vi.) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 1:17\ft Parts. When they went, they went by their four parts. That is, indifferently to any of their sides, either forward or backward, to the right or to the left. (Challoner) --- Their motion was connected with the chariot, ver. 20. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:18\ft Eyes, like Argus, or the tail of a peacock. (Calmet) --- The eye is sometimes put for a colour. (Grotius)\f*
\f + \fr 1:20\ft Life. They were moved like the rest by the whirlwind, or by living creatures. They seemed to be animated, as Homer describes Vulcan's tripods.\f*
\f + \fr 1:22\ft Crystal, or sapphire, ver. 26., and Ezechiel 10:1. This shining sky was like the footstool of the Lord, and rested on eight wings, ver. 9, 23.\f*
\f + \fr 1:24\ft Voice. The motion of the wings made a noise like a torrent, or thunder. --- God. Hebrew, "self-sufficient," as Septuagint, etc., render it, ikanou. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "like the voice of the Almighty." (Haydock) --- Down; or rather ceased to make such a noise, ver. 25. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:26\ft Upon it. This might be omitted, as the Vulgate has only desuper, above. (Haydock) --- God was pleased to assume the shape of man, seated on the throne.\f*
\f + \fr 1:27\ft Amber, or orichalcum, ver. 4.\f*
\f + \fr 1:28\ft Rainbow, encircling the sky blue throne and the flame. Nothing could be more dazzling, nor better manifest the subjection of man. (Calmet) --- The prophet saw four visions at once; the whirlwind, (ver. 4.) the living creatures, (ver. 5.) the wheels, (ver. 15.) and the man seated on a throne, in the sky, ver. 26. To explain all these mysteries, a large commentary would scarcely suffice. (Worthington) --- The tempest, cloud, and fire, shew the impending ruin of the Jews. The ministers of God are ever ready to execute his orders. The wisdom of Providence is denoted by the name of the cherubim, the connection of causes by the four wheels, etc. (Menochius) --- God appears in his chariot going to war. He denounces vengeance on the guilty, Ezechiel 2.; Ezechiel 43. See Cornelius a Lapide. (Haydock)\f*

\cd The prophet receives his commission.
\p
\v 1 This *was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw, and I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke. And he said to me: Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.
\p
\v 2 And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me, and he set me upon my feet: and I heard him speaking to me,
\p
\v 3 And saying: Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people, that hath revolted from me, they, and their fathers, have transgressed my covenant even unto this day.
\p
\v 4 And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face, and of an obstinate heart: and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God:
\p
\v 5 If so be they at least will hear, and if so be they will forbear, for they are a provoking house: and they shall know that there hath been a prophet in the midst of them.
\p
\v 6 And thou, O son of man, fear not, neither be thou afraid of their words: for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers, and thou dwellest with scorpions. Fear not their words, neither be thou dismayed at their looks: for they are a provoking house.
\p
\v 7 And thou shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear, and forbear: for they provoke me to anger.
\p
\v 8 But thou, O son of man, hear all that I say to thee: and do not thou provoke me, as that house provoketh me: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.
\p
\v 9 And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent to me, wherein was a book rolled up: and he spread it before me, *and it was written within and without: and there were written in it lamentations, and canticles, and woe.
\f + \fr 2:1\ft Year of the World 3409.\f*
\x + \xo 2:9\xt Apocalypse 1:5.\x*
\f + \fr 2:1\ft Face, to adore God. (Menochius) --- Son of man. Our Saviour, out of humility, takes this title, which no other gave him; as the angel does commonly to this prophet, who was his figure: few else have received it, (Daniel 8:17.) but the reason is not known. (Worthington) --- God here teaches Ezechiel not to boast of the honour shewn to him, since he must always remember that he is but a feeble mortal. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:2\ft Spirit of prophecy; (St. Jerome; Tirinus) or, I revived, and took courage.\f*
\f + \fr 2:3\ft Israel. His commission was chiefly to them. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:5\ft Forbear to sin. (Haydock) --- He thus insinuates free-will. (St. Jerome) --- If they refuse to hear my prophet, they will at least perceive that they are inexcusable. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:6\ft Scorpions. This people is no less destructive (Haydock) and hardened, Psalm 117:12. --- For might be better rendered, "though." (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:8\ft Eat. "If we do not eat the open book, we cannot teach." (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 2:9\ft Without. This was only done when the work was long. (Calmet) --- Scriptus et in tergo, necdum finitus Orestes. (Juvenal 1.) --- Septuagint, "past and present things were written in it." (Haydock) --- Woe, or the words of the penitent, of the blessed, and of the damned. (Worthington) --- The canticles were of a mournful nature, and the prophet had sorrows to announce. (Calmet)\f*

\cd The prophet eats the book, and receives further instructions: the office of a watchman.
\p
\v 1 And *he said to me: Son of man, eat all that thou shalt find: eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel.
\p
\v 2 And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book:
\p
\v 3 And he said to me: Son of man, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this book, which I give thee. *And I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.
\p
\v 4 And he said to me: Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them.
\p
\v 5 For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel:
\p
\v 6 Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand: and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee.
\p
\v 7 But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee: because they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead, and an obstinate heart.
\p
\v 8 Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces, and thy forehead harder than their foreheads.
\p
\v 9 I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint: fear them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence: for they are a provoking house.
\p
\v 10 And he said to me: Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:
\p
\v 11 And go get thee in to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If so be they will hear, and will forbear.
\p
\v 12 And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying: Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his place.
\p
\v 13 And the noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and the noise of a great commotion.
\p
\v 14 The spirit also lifted me, and took me up: and I went away in bitterness, in the indignation of my spirit: for the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me.
\p
\v 15 And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat: and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them.
\p
\v 16 And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 17 *Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.
\p
\v 18 If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his wicked way, and live: the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.
\p
\v 19 But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted from his wickedness, and from his evil way: he indeed shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\p
\v 20 Moreover, if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity: I will lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his sin, and his justices, which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand.
\p
\v 21 But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he doth not sin: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy soul.
\p
\v 22 And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me: Rise, and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.
\p
\v 23 And I rose up, and went forth into the plain: and behold the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which *I saw by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.
\p
\v 24 And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in, and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house.
\p
\v 25 And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them.
\p
\v 26 And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth: because they are a provoking house.
\p
\v 27 But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear: and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a provoking house.

By this eating of the book, was signified the diligent attention and affection with which we are to receive and embrace the word of God; and to let it as it were, sink into our interior by devout meditation.

\f + \fr 3:6\ft Unknown. Hebrew, "heavy." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "hard." (Haydock) --- It is not above thy strength, Deuteronomy 30:12. --- To thee. He insinuates that the Gentiles would obey the apostles. (St. Jerome) --- But the time was not yet come. (Calmet) --- From this text and Matthew 11:21., it appears that "the same grace" is accepted by some and rejected by others, as "more grace is added to the former, which was sufficient before, and by this....is made effectual" through God's mercy, Romans ix. (Worthington) --- Those who reject the first grace, can blame only themselves, if they receive no more. The same grace falling on a heat better prepared by God, like seed on good soil, is more fruitful.\f*
\f + \fr 3:7\ft Hard. Literally, "rubbed" like a stone, or brass; attrita. (Haydock) --- God's ambassadors (Ephesians 6:20.; Calmet) must do their utmost. (Haydock) --- The success must not puff them up, nor the failure too much depressed them, as all regards God, (Matthew 10:40.) who will know how to make things conduce to his own glory. They must only bewail the blindness of sinners. (Calmet) --- The care of them, and not the cure, will be required at their hands, ver. 19. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 3:8\ft Harder. If they will not blush, thou shalt not be ashamed to lay their disorders before their eyes, though they be such as ought not to be mentioned, as becomes saints. (Haydock) See Ezechiel 16.; chap 22. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 3:12\ft Spirit; wind (Hugo) or angel, took me through the air; (Prado.) or, I went willingly. (St. Jerome) --- Commotion, like an earthquake, (Hebrew; Septuagint) occasioned by the motion of the chariot, or the voice of the cherubim, ver. 13.\f*
\f + \fr 3:14\ft Spirit, resolved to rebuke (Calmet) sinners. Septuagint, "the spirit of the Lord also lifted me....and I went aloft (like a meteor; meteoros) by the impulse of my spirit; for the hand of the Lord upon me was strong; and I went loft, to the captivity, and passed through them....conversing in the midst of them." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 3:15\ft The heap of new corn. It was the name of a place; in Hebrew, Telabib, (Challoner) as the Chaldean leaves it (Menochius) with the three Greek interpreters. (Calmet) --- Tel means "a heap," and abib "new corn." (Haydock) --- There was no new wheat in the fourth month, but rather in May or June, Ezechiel 1:1. Ptolemy places Thelda near the Chaboras. --- Mourning; or Protestants, "astonished," like Job's friends, for people dead in sin. (Haydock) --- Many suppose that he never spoke. Yet this is not certain, (ver. 11.; Calmet) though probable from ver. 16. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 3:17\ft Watchman: the usual title of those placed over others, Ezechiel 33:2., and Isaias 21:6. Let none perish through thy neglect. (Calmet) --- "He (the pastor) kills the man whom he delivers up to death by silence." (St. Gregory, hom. 11:9.)\f*

Thy sin is great, whatever become of him. But if he be damned, though he must blame himself chiefly, yet the blood of his soul shall cry for vengeance more than Abel's. (Haydock) --- Before him, taking away my grace in punishment of his revolt. (Worthington) --- If thou neglect to attempt reclaiming him, thou shalt perish with him; (St. Gregory) or if he be exposed to trial, and thou abandon him, (Vatable) or if thou neglect to husband well the precious moments, when I open his eyes, and fill him with apprehensions of his dangerous state, I will require, etc. (Origin; St. Jerome) --- Remembered. Ingratitude causes the fruits of virtue to decay, and former crimes to revive, in some sense. (St. Thomas, [Summa Theologiae] 3:p. q. 88. a. 1.) (Matthew 5:26.) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 3:21\ft Warn. It is the duty of a pastor to warn the just as well as sinners. (Worthington) --- It will not suffice to do this publicly: sometimes we must go from house to house, like St. Paul, and compel those who are in the hedges to enter the marriage feast, by the most persuasive arguments. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 3:25\ft Bands. It is uncertain whether by his order, or they supposed he was deranged, as our Saviour's brethren meant to treat him, Mark 3:21. The Chaldean explains it figuratively of God's order, attaching the prophet to his service. (Calmet) --- But real chains would more forcibly shew the future captivity of Juda (Haydock) which the prophet declared both by words and actions. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 3:26\ft House. "When there is a multitude of sins, (or sinners; peccatorum) the offenders are unworthy of being corrected by the Lord." (St. Jerome) --- The prophet's silence might suffice to admonish them. (Calmet) --- He heard the Lord's commands to Ezechiel 11:24., before he spoke to the people. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 3:27\ft Forbeareth. Septuagint, "disbelieveth, let him disbelieve." So we read, He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; (Apocalypse 22:11.) which denotes the most desperate condition. (Haydock) --- Aquila (2 edition) has, "he who abandons, shall be abandoned." (St. Jerome) --- The man who makes good use of grace shall receive more; but he who despises the offers of God, shall be justly deprived of them in his greatest need. (Calmet)\f*

\cd A prophetic description of the siege of Jerusalem, and the famine that shall reign there.
\p
\v 1 And *thou, O son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and draw upon it the plan of the city of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 And lay siege against it, and build forts, and cast up a mount, and set a camp against it, and place battering rams round about it.
\p
\v 3 And take unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face resolutely against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: it is a sign to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take upon thee their iniquity.
\p
\v 5 And I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
\p
\v 6 And when thou hast accomplished this, thou shalt sleep again upon thy right side: and *thou shalt take upon thee the iniquity of the house of Juda forty days: a day for a year, yea, a day for a year I have appointed to thee.**
\p
\v 7 And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of Jerusalem, and thy arm shall be stretched out: and thou shalt prophesy against it.
\p
\v 8 Behold I have encompassed thee with bands: and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
\p
\v 9 And take to thee wheat and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
\p
\v 10 And thy meat that thou shalt eat, shall be in weight twenty staters a-day: from time to time thou shalt eat it.
\p
\v 11 And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time thou shalt drink it.
\p
\v 12 And thou shalt eat it as barley-bread baked under the ashes: and thou shalt cover it, in their sight, with the dung that cometh out of a man.
\p
\v 13 And the Lord said: So shall the children of Israel *eat their bread, all filthy, among the nations whither I will cast them out.
\p
\v 14 And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, behold my soul hath not been defiled, and from my infancy even till now, I have not eaten any thing that died of itself, or was torn by beasts, and no unclean flesh hath entered into my mouth.
\p
\v 15 And he said to me: Behold I have given thee neat's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt make thy bread therewith.
\p
\v 16 And he said to me: Son of man: *Behold I will break in pieces the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care: and they shall drink water by measure, and in distress.
\p
\v 17 So that when bread and water fail, every man may fall against his brother, and they may pine away in their iniquities.

\f + \fr 4:2\ft Cast up. The ditch would be about three feet deep, and the earth being thrown up, people might approach the town with less danger. (Worthington) --- The besieged were thus also prevented from going out, 4 Kings 25:1. Forts or towers were erected to overlook and clear the walls. --- Rams. This is the first time we find them mentioned. Homer is silent about them; (Calmet) and the ancient sieges lasted so long, because people had not found out the art of demolishing the walls. (Diodorus ii.)\f*
\f + \fr 4:3\ft Pan, or plate, on which bread was usually baked. This was to represent the walls of the city. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 4:4\ft Sleep. Hebrew, "lie down." (Menochius) --- He eat at intervals. (Calmet) --- Iniquities, or punishments. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 4:5\ft Three, etc. St. Jerome says some "Vulgate," (Haydock) Latin, (Calmet) or rather incorrect Greek (Haydock) copies read 100, others 150. See Origen, etc. (Calmet) --- The Alexandrian copy has the former, (Haydock) the Roman edition the latter number; and is followed by Theodoret and Maldonat. (Calmet) --- But the more accurate Septuagint agree with the Hebrew, etc. The captivity of Israel must be dated from Phacee, (4 Kings 15:29.) to the end of the reign of Darius Memnon, who espoused Esther, and granted liberty "to all the Jews;" or rather from Manathem, (4 Kings 15:19.) to the 28th of the same king Assuerus. Thus God's "grace, we think, and we may so speak without arrogance, has enabled us to explain this difficulty, which no other has done." (St. Jerome) --- Many confound the duration of the iniquity of Israel with that of Juda, forming 430 years; and they explain it of the time during which the nation had prevaricated. But this seems unnatural. We may rather conclude, that the prophet speaks of a separate judgment, and dates from the destruction of Samaria and of Jerusalem. The former city was taken the year of the world 3283. If we add 390 years, we shall find the year 3673 the very year when Alexander [the Great] overcame Darius, and soon after granted the Jews full liberty to return, or live according to their own laws. This he granted to those in Babylon, and to the Israelites (Calmet) in Media. Josephus, Antiquities xi. ultra et contra Apion 1:--- Philadelphus afterwards liberated many in Egypt, (Josephus, Antiquities 12:2.) as Osee 11:11. had foretold. The chastisement of Juda must be dated from the destruction of Jerusalem under Sedecias, till Darius, the Mede, favoured the Jews about forty years afterwards. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome only allows forty years to have elapsed from the first of Jechonias till the first of Cyrus. The want of an exact chronology gives rise to many such difficulties. (Haydock) --- It is very hard to explain how the ten tribes were 390 and the two tribes 40 years in captivity, as it is certain that the latter were seventy year banished from their own country. (Worthington) --- Perhaps during the last thirty their condition was greatly ameliorated, after the decree of Cyrus, though the liberation was only perfect under Hystaspes and Esther. (Haydock) --- The iniquity of Israel, from Solomon to Salmanasar, lasted 390 years; and that of Juda, under the reign of Manasses, was most abominable for the space of forty years; (Tournemine) or it continued so long from the 18th of Josias till the 4th, after the city was destroyed, and the land became a desert. (Usher, the year of the world 3380 to 3420.) --- But how shall the reign of the virtuous Josias be included in this period? (Haydock) --- The action of the prophet lying 430 days, denoted the length of the siege of Jerusalem, during which extreme scarcity should be felt, and also the captivity of the people. Some have thought that he could not remain 390 days on one side, and that all passed in spirit. But what impression would that make upon the people? He was chained down, (Calmet) to represent their miserable condition. (Haydock) --- Praedo saw a fool who lay tied in one posture for above fifteen years. (Calmet) --- The remaining so long in one posture must have been painful to the prophet. (Tirinus)\f*
\f + \fr 4:7\ft Siege, which shall be most terrible; (Haydock) 390 days: the pillage shall last other forty. (Tirinus) --- So many years have the people transgressed. --- Out. Hebrew, "naked." Thus various barbarians fight. --- Prophesy, not by words, (chap. 8:26.) but by actions. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 4:10\ft Staters, sicles, each being equal to 9 dwt. 2.57 gr. Eng. The hin contained 1 gal. 2 pints. (Arbuthnot.) (Haydock) --- He had an allowance of ten ounces a-day. (Calmet) (Tirinus)\f*
\f + \fr 4:12\ft Barley, the worst or usual food of the poor. (Haydock) --- Ashes, to denote hurry. (Calmet) --- Cover with hot ashes, (Haydock) formed of dry excrements. (Calmet) --- That of oxen is still used in Egypt, (Val. ep. xi.) and in some parts of England, by the poor people. (Hooke.) --- This was more tolerable, (Calmet) and God agrees to substitute it, ver. 15. Hebrew, "Thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and shalt bake," (Protestants) or "hide it," etc. (Septuagint) (Haydock) --- "The law itself, which the Jews read and do not understand, is this ember cake covered with human dung." (Philippians 3:8.) --- "They adore not idols, but do all for the belly and for earthly goods." (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 4:13\ft Filthy. Israel was less careful to avoid uncleannesses than Juda. Hence the prophet eats only during 390 days, Osee 9:3. (Calmet) --- While the city was pillage for forty days, the prisoners would procure better food, ver. 7. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 4:14\ft Ah. He makes the same exclamation as Jeremias, 1:6. Hebrew aha. Theodotion, "Oh!" Septuagint and Symmachus, "by no means." (Haydock) --- God forbid. Excrements make a person legally unclean, Deuteronomy 23:12. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 4:15\ft Neats, or "oxen;" boum. Protestants, "cow's dung." (Haydock) --- God allows him to bake his bread under such ashes. (Calmet) --- So great is his condescension towards his friends! (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 4:16\ft Staff. As this supports the weak, so bread nourishes all men, (Worthington) particularly the bread of life. (St. Jerome) --- Very little food, (Calmet) and that of a nauseous kind, (Haydock) would be found during the siege. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 4:17\ft When. Protestants, "they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity." (Haydock)\f*

\cd The judgments of God upon the Jews are foreshewn under the type of the prophet's hair.
\p
\v 1 And *thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, that shaveth the hair, and cause it to pass over thy head, and over thy beard; and take thee a balance to weigh in, and divide the hair.
\p
\v 2 A third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city, according to the fulfilling of the days of the siege; and thou shalt take a third part, and cut it in pieces with the knife all round about; and the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind, and I will draw out the sword after them.
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt take thereof a small number; and shalt bind them in the skirt of thy cloak.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt take of them again, and shalt cast them in the midst of the fire, and shalt burn them with fire; and out of it shall come forth a fire into all the house of Israel.
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord God: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the nations, and the countries round about her.
\p
\v 6 And she hath despised my judgments, so as to be more wicked than the Gentiles; and my commandments, more than the countries that are round about her; for they have cast off my judgments, and have not walked in my commandments.
\p
\v 7 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Because you have surpassed the Gentiles that are round about you, and have not walked in my commandments, and have not kept my judgments, and have not done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you:
\p
\v 8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I myself will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 9 And I will do in thee that which I have not done: and the like to which I will do no more, because of all thy abominations.
\p
\v 10 Therefore, the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers: and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter thy whole remnant into every wind.
\p
\v 11 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God : Because thou hast violated my sanctuary with all thy offences, and with all thy abominations: I will also break thee in pieces, and my eye shall not spare, and I will not have any pity.
\p
\v 12 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee: and a third part of thee shall fall by the sword round about thee: and a third part of thee will I scatter into every wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.
\p
\v 13 *And I will accomplish my fury, and will cause my indignation to rest upon them, and I will be comforted; and they shall know, that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my indignation in them.
\p
\v 14 And I will make thee desolate, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of every one that passeth by.
\p
\v 15 And thou shalt be a reproach, and a scoff, an example, and an astonishment amongst the nations that are round about thee, when I shall have executed judgments in thee in anger, and in indignation, and in wrathful rebukes.
\p
\v 16 I the Lord have spoken it: When I shall send upon them the grievous arrows of famine, which shall bring death, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will gather together famine against you:* and I will break among you the staff of bread.
\p
\v 17 And I will send in upon you famine, and evil beasts, unto utter destruction: and pestilence, and blood shall pass through thee, and I will bring in the sword upon thee. I, the Lord, have spoken it.

\f + \fr 5:1\ft That. Hebrew, "the scissors of clippers." The same term is used for clipping sheep as for cutting hair. Shaving was not probably then in use. --- Beard, as in mourning or for ignominy, 2 Kings 10:4., and Jeremias 47:5. --- Balance, to shew that God does nothing unjustly. (Calmet) --- The hair. Literally, "them." (Haydock) --- This was to be done before he lay down. Hew was to burn, cut, and divide the hair as the siege represented on the tile advanced, to denote that some should perish in the city by famine, others by the sword, while a few should be scattered among the nations: yet of these a small number should be gathered round Godolias, and perish with him, or in Egypt, etc., and the rest be thence led captive to Babylon.\f*
\f + \fr 5:2\ft Third. Septuagint and Theodotion read "a fourth," as also [in] ver. 12., (Calmet) thus assigning half to be burnt by death (pestilence) and famine. The other half of the people falls a prey to the sword and to captivity. The pestilence, famine, and the sword, were the three usual scourges left to David's choice, (2 Kings xxiv.) which here destroy each a fourth part, while the rest become captives. Yet even of this third or fourth part, many engage in civil broils, and perish. St. Jerome hints that the Septuagint is interpolated from Theodotion, ver. 12, and that their version only comprised the pentateuch. But the other books went at least under the same title; and there must be some mistake in the words asterisked, since they occur in the Hebrew, Vulgate, etc., third being only substituted for fourth: "And a fourth part of thee shall fall by the sword." The Hebrew is rather less degrading to the Jews, as there would be thus at most one-third preserved, instead of a part only of one-fourth. See Deuteronomy 27:4., and Jeremias 52:28. --- Take. Septuagint add here, "a fourth part; and shalt burn it in the midst of it; and a fourth thou shalt cut," etc. (Haydock) --- He was thus to deal with a part of the hair during 390 days, (Menochius) or at the end of them.

\f + \fr 5:7\ft Surpassed in numbers, (Symmachus) or rather in wickedness. (Chaldean) (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "because you have been incited by the," etc. (Haydock) --- Judgments. You have been less attached to my service than the Gentiles have been to their idols. Some think that not is here superfluous, as it is omitted [in] Ezechiel 11:12. But it is wrong to imitate the Gentiles, and worse to surpass them in crimes.\f*

\f + \fr 5:10\ft Fathers. This is not specified in history. Famine prevailed, 4 Kings 25:3.; and we find something similar, Lamentations 4:10., (Calmet) and Baruch 2:(Worthington) --- It is probable, therefore, that these threats were realized. (Theodoret) (Deuteronomy 28:53.) --- Scatter. Literally, "winnow." (Haydock) --- The Jewish nation was never again all together in the promised land.\f*

\cd The prophet sees, in a vision, the abominations committed in Jerusalem, which determine the Lord to spare them no longer.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the ancients of Juda sat before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.
\p
\v 2 And I saw, and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins, and downward, fire: and from his loins, and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of amber.
\p
\v 3 *And the likeness of a hand was put forth, and took me by a lock of my head: and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem, near the inner gate, that looked towards the north, where was set the idol of jealousy to provoke to jealousy.
\p
\v 4 And behold the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I had seen in the plain.
\p
\v 5 And he said to me: Son of man, lift up thy eyes towards the way of the north. And I lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north: and behold on the north side of the gate of the altar the idol of jealousy in the very entry.
\p
\v 6 And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou see, thinkest thou, what these are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should depart far off from my sanctuary? and turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations.
\p
\v 7 And he brought me in to the door of the court: and I saw, and behold a hole in the wall.
\p
\v 8 And he said to me: Son of man, dig in the wall. And when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.
\p
\v 9 And he said to me: Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they commit here.
\p
\v 10 And I went in and saw, and behold every form of creeping things, and of living creatures, the abomination, and all the idols of the house of Israel were painted on the wall all round about.
\p
\v 11 And seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and Jezonias, the son of Saphan, stood in the midst of them, that stood before the pictures: and every one had a censer in his hand: and a cloud of smoke went up from the incense.
\p
\v 12 And he said to me: Surely thou seest, O son of man, what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in private in his chamber: for they say: The Lord seeth us not, the Lord hath forsaken the earth.
\p
\v 13 And he said to me: If thou turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations which these commit.
\p
\v 14 And he brought me in by the door of the gate of the Lord's house, which looked to the north: and behold women sat there mourning for Adonis.
\p
\v 15 And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: but turn thee again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
\p
\v 16 And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord: and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, having their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces to the east: and they adored towards the rising of the sun.
\p
\v 17 And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: Is this a light thing to the house of Juda, that they should commit these abominations which they have committed here: because they have filled the land with iniquity, and have turned to provoke me to anger? and behold they put a branch to their nose.
\p
\v 18 Therefore I also will deal with them in my wrath: my eye shall not spare them, neither will I shew mercy: and when they shall cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.

\f + \fr 8:1\ft Sixth of the prophet's captivity, (Calmet) in August, the year of the world 3411. (Usher) --- He had rested on his left or right side, whenever he slept during 430 days, and on the following had this vision. (Worthington) --- He was stationed in spirit at the northern gate leading to the court of the priests, and beheld the glory of God and the idol of jealousy. He saw the people, men and women, adoring idols, and priests worshipping the sun, Ezechiel 9. God rests on the gate of the temple, and orders a man to sign those who were to live, and six others to destroy the rest. The prophet prays, Ezechiel 10. God orders the man clothed in linen to take coals from the cherubim, and sprinkle them through the city. The throne goes to receive the Lord, Ezechiel 11. Ezechiel prophesies against many, at the eastern gate; and God informs him that the former captives shall return, but that the wicked at Jerusalem shall perish. His chariot then rests on the mountain to the east of the city. Thus his reasons for punishing the people become evident.\f*

In Hebrew the name is Tammuz, (Challoner) which means "concealed," as Adonis signifies "my lord." This idol, which the Egyptians called Osiris, was placed in a coffin, and bewailed till it was pretended he was come to life, when rejoicings took place. Obscene pictures were carried about; and the more honest pagans were ashamed of these practices, which began in Egypt, and became almost general. Moses alludes to them, Leviticus 19:27., and Deuteronomy 14:1. (Calmet) --- David and Solomon say that the image was made of brass, with eyes of lead, which seemed to weep, melting when it was hot. (Worthington) --- But this is destitute of proof.\f*
\f + \fr 8:16\ft Men. Twelve priests and as many Levites officiated daily. The high priest made the twenty-fifth, 1 Paralipomenon xxiv. --- Sun. They prayed to God, turning their faces to the west: but here they despised him, and adored the sun, Job 31:26. (Calmet) --- This posture was common. Illi ad surgentem conversi lumina solum. (Virgil, Aeneid xii.) (Serv.) --- Christians did the like, though the reason is not ascertained. (Calmet) --- It might be because Christ is the orient, and not to resemble the Jews. There was no danger of their being taken for idolaters. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 8:17\ft Nose, to hide their faces respectfully, (Calmet) when they look at the sun rising. (Haydock) --- A thyrsus was used in honour of Bacchus, who is often confounded with the sun.

\v 1 And *he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city are at hand, and every one hath a destroying weapon in his hand.
\p
\v 2 And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the north: and each one had his weapon of destruction in his hand: and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn at his reins: and they went in, and stood by the brazen altar.
\p
\v 3 And the glory of the Lord of Israel went up from the cherub, upon which he was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man that was clothed with linen, and had a writer's inkhorn at his loins.
\p
\v 4 And the Lord said to him: Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem: *and mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in the midst thereof.
\p
\v 5 And to the others he said in my hearing: Go ye after him through the city, and strike: let not your eyes spare, nor be ye moved with pity.
\p
\v 6 Utterly destroy old and young, maidens, children, and women: but upon whomsoever you shall see Thau, kill him not, and begin ye at my sanctuary. So they began at the ancient men, who were before the house.
\p
\v 7 And he said to them: Defile the house, and ill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew them that were in the city.
\p
\v 8 And the slaughter being ended, I was left: and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem?
\p
\v 9 And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Juda, is exceedingly great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness: for they have said: The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.
\p
\v 10 Therefore neither shall my eye spare, nor will I have pity: I will requite their way upon their head.

But St. Jerome, and other interpreters, conclude it was the form of the letter thau, which, in the ancient Hebrew character, was the form of a cross. (Challoner) --- Of this many inscriptions still extant bear witness. (Montfaucon.) --- Some Rabbins allow that the last letter was used but in honour of "the law," Thorah. The cross is supposed to be the hieroglyphic of a future life, (Hist. Rufini. 2:29.) and found frequently in the pictures or (Haydock) in the tables of Isis. But it rather represents a key. Soldiers who were acquitted received the letter T, and those who were sentenced to die had Th, (Calmet) alluding to Thanatos, "death." (Haydock) --- We may, however, suppose that if God designated any letter, it would be some letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and accordingly the last had formerly the figure of a cross: "X" though this text may signify "a sign" in general. The virtuous would be discriminated from the guilty, as if they were marked. (Calmet) --- The door-posts of the Hebrews were stained with blood, in Egypt, to shew that all should be redeemed by that of Christ; and here those who shall be saved, received the mark of his cross. This sign has always been held in veneration among Christians, (Worthington) and used in conferring baptism, consecrating the blessed Eucharist, etc. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lv. in Matthew, and lxxxiv. in John) (St. Augustine, tr. cxviii. in John, and ser. ci. de temp., etc.) --- It appeared to Constantine with this inscription, "In this conquer;" (Eusebius, vit. 1:22.) and again over Jerusalem; (St. Cyril, ep. ad Constantium.) and will be borne before Christ, at his last coming, (Matthew xxiv.) to the joy of those who have performed their baptismal promises, and to the confusion (Worthington) of the enemies of the cross of Christ.

\p
\v 1 And *I saw, and behold in the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubims, there appeared over them as it were the sapphire-stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
\p
\v 2 And he spoke to the man, that was clothed with linen, and said: Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubims, and fill thy hand with the coals of fire that are between the cherubims, and pour them out upon the city. And he went in, in my sight:
\p
\v 3 And the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.
\p
\v 4 And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from above the cherub to the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.
\p
\v 5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even to the outward court, as the voice of God Almighty speaking.
\p
\v 6 And when he had commanded the man that was clothed with linen, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the cherubims: he went in and stood beside the wheel.
\p
\v 7 And one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims: and he took, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went forth.
\p
\v 8 And there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a man's hand under their wings.
\p
\v 9 And I saw, and behold there were four wheels by the cherubims: one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite-stone:
\p
\v 10 And as to their appearance, all four were alike: as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.
\p
\v 11 And when they went, they went by four ways: and they turned not when they went: but to the place whither they first turned, the rest also followed, and did not turn back.
\p
\v 12 And their whole body, and their necks, and their hands, and their wings, and the circles were full of eyes, round about the four wheels.
\p
\v 13 And these wheels he called voluble, in my hearing.
\p
\v 14 And every one had four faces: one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face, the face of a man: and in the third was the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of an eagle.
\p
\v 15 And the cherubims were lifted up: this is the living creature that I had seen by the river Chobar.
\p
\v 16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels also went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings, to mount up from the earth, the wheels staid not behind, but were by them.
\p
\v 17 When they stood, these stood: and when they were lifted up, these were lifted up: for the spirit of life was in them.
\p
\v 18 And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the temple: and stood over the cherubims.
\p
\v 19 And the cherubims lifting up their wings, were raised from the earth before me: and as they went out, the wheels also followed: and it stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.

\v 1 And *the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh towards the rising of the sun: and behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men: and I saw in the midst of them Jezonias, the son of Azur, and Pheltias, the son of Banaias, princes of the people.
\p
\v 2 And he said to me: Son of man, these are the men that study iniquity, and frame a wicked counsel in this city,
\p
\v 3 Saying: Were not houses lately built? This city is the cauldron, and we the flesh.
\p
\v 4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.
\p
\v 5 And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me: Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the thoughts of your heart.
\p
\v 6 You have killed a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
\p
\v 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, and this is the cauldron: and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof.
\p
\v 8 You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 9 And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemies, and I will execute judgments upon you.
\p
\v 10 You shall fall by the sword: I will judge you in the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 11 This shall not be as a cauldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof: I will judge you in the borders of Israel.
\p
\v 12 And you shall know that I am the Lord: because you have not walked in my commandments, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you.
\p
\v 13 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pheltias, the son of Banaias, died: and I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice: and said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God: wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of Israel?
\p
\v 14 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 15 Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy kinsmen, and all the house of Israel, all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get ye far from the Lord, the land is given in possession to us.
\p
\v 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because I have removed them far off among the Gentiles, and because I have scattered them among the countries, I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.
\p
\v 17 Therefore, speak to them: Thus saith the Lord God: I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
\p
\v 18 And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the scandals, and all the abominations thereof from thence.
\p
\v 19 *And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:
\p
\v 20 That they may walk in my commandments, and keep my judgments, and do them: and that they may be my people, and I may be their God.
\p
\v 21 But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and abominations, I will lay their way upon their head, saith the Lord God.

\f + \fr 11:3\ft Built, etc. These men despised the predictions and threats of the prophets; who declared to them from God, that the city should be destroyed and the inhabitants carried into captivity: and they made use of this kind of argument against the prophets, that the city so far from being like to be destroyed, had lately been augmented by the building of new houses; from whence they further inferred, by way of a proverb, using the similitude of a cauldron, out of which the flesh is not taken till it is thoroughly boiled and fit to be eaten, that they should not be carried away out of their city, but there end their days in peace. (Challoner) --- They thought themselves secure, (Worthington) and laughed at the menaces of Jeremias, 1:15. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "The destruction is not soon coming. Let us build;" (Pagnin; Menochius) or, "It is not time to build." (Calmet)\f*

\f + \fr 11:10\ft Israel. They pretended that they should die in peace in Jerusalem: God tells them it should not be so, but that they should be judged and condemned, and fall by the sword in the borders of Israel; viz., in Reblatha, in the land of Emath, where all their chief men were put to death by order of Nabuchodonosor, 4 Kings xxv., and Jeremias 52:10, 27.

(Haydock) --- This happened in a vision. Yet (Calmet) he probably died suddenly about his time. (Lyranus)\f*
\f + \fr 11:15\ft Thy brethren, etc. He speaks of them that had been carried away captives before, who were despised by them that remained in Jerusalem; but, as the prophet here declares to them from God, should be in a more happy condition than they, and after some time return from their captivity. (Challoner) --- David had been insulted in like manner, 1 Kings 26:19. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 11:16\ft A little. Hebrew, "for a short time, a sanctuary," or temple. They shall find all things in me. The Christian Church was never more pure than during the first persecutions, when her children could not assemble freely, or build temples. (Calmet) --- God will never totally abandon her, Jeremias 4:27., etc. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 11:18\ft Scandals: idols. They relapsed no more into idolatry, (Calmet) as a nation, though some fell in the persecution of Epiphanes. (Haydock)\f*

Theodoret well observes, that the person on the throne represented Him, the upper part of the body being different from the lower, (chap. 1:26.) to denote the two natures. (Calmet)\f*

\cd The prophet foresheweth, by signs, the captivity of Sedecias, and the desolation of the people: all which shall quickly come to pass.
\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a provoking house: who have eyes to see, and see not: and ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a provoking house.
\p
\v 3 Thou, therefore, O son of man, prepare thee all necessaries for removing, and remove by day in their sight: and thou shalt remove out of thy place to another place in their sight, if so be they will regard it: for they are a provoking house.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one that is removing by day in their sight: and thou shalt go forth in the evening in their presence, as one goeth forth that removeth his dwelling.
\p
\v 5 Dig thee a way through the wall before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth through it.
\p
\v 6 In their sight thou shalt be carried out upon men's shoulders, thou shalt be carried out in the dark: thou shalt cover thy face, and shalt not see the ground: for I have set thee for a sign of things to come to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 7 I did, therefore, as he had commanded me: I brought forth my goods by day, as the goods of one that removeth: and in the evening I digged through the wall with my hand: and I went forth in the dark, and was carried on men's shoulders in their sight.
\p
\v 8 And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying:
\p
\v 9 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the provoking house, said to thee: What art thou doing?
\p
\v 10 Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: This burden concerneth my prince that is in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel, that are among them.
\p
\v 11 Say: I am a sign of things to come to you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall be removed from their dwellings, and go into captivity.
\p
\v 12 And the prince that is in the midst of them, shall be carried on shoulders, he shall go forth in the dark: they shall dig through the wall to bring him out: his face shall be covered, that he may not see the ground with his eyes.
\p
\v 13 *And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, into the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die.
\p
\v 14 And all that are about him, his guards, and his troops, I will scatter into every wind: and I will draw out the sword after them.
\p
\v 15 And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have dispersed them among the nations, and scattered them in the countries.
\p
\v 16 And I will leave a few men of them from the sword, and from the famine, and from the pestilence: that they may declare all their wicked deeds among the nations whither they shall go: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 17 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 18 Son of man, eat thy bread in trouble: and drink thy water in hurry and sorrow.
\p
\v 19 And say to the people of the land: Thus saith the Lord God to them that dwell in Jerusalem, in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread in care, and drink their water in desolation: That the land may become desolate from the multitude that is therein, for the iniquity of all that dwell therein.
\p
\v 20 And the cities that are now inhabited, shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 21 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 22 Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel? saying: The days shall be prolonged, and every vision shall fail.
\p
\v 23 Say to them, therefore: Thus saith the Lord God: I will make this proverb to cease, neither shall it be any more a common saying in Israel: and tell them that the days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
\p
\v 24 For there shall be no more any vain visions, nor doubtful divination in the midst of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 25 For I the Lord will speak: and what word soever I shall speak, it shall come to pass, and shall not be prolonged any more: but in your days, ye provoking house, I will speak the word, and will do it, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 26 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 27 Son of man, behold the house of Israel, they that say: The vision that this man seeth, is for many days to come: and this man prophesieth of times afar off.
\p
\v 28 Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Not one word of mine shall be prolonged any more: the word that I shall speak shall be accomplished, saith the Lord God.

If what they announced came to pass, they attributed it to chance; (Calmet) if it did not, being only conditional, they ridiculed this idea as a mere subterfuge. (Haydock) --- As the prophets had long before foretold the captivity, and it had not yet taken place, (Worthington) in general, though many were already in exile, (Haydock) they concluded that it would never be realized. Thus heretics deny the general judgment, 1 Peter 3:(Worthington) --- Every vision, on this head, ver. 28. Many events were revealed that regarded the times of Christ, Daniel ix., etc. (Haydock)\f*

\cd God declares against false prophets and prophetesses, that deceive the people with lies.
\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy thou against the prophets of Israel that prophesy: and thou shalt say to them that prophesy out of their own heart: Hear ye the word of the Lord:
\p
\v 3 Thus saith the Lord God: *Woe to the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit, and see nothing.
\p
\v 4 Thy prophets, O Israel, were like foxes in the deserts.
\p
\v 5 You have not gone up to face the enemy, nor have you set up a wall for the house of Israel, to stand in battle in the day of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 They see vain things, and they foretell lies, saying: The Lord saith: whereas the Lord hath not sent them: and they have persisted to confirm what they have said.
\p
\v 7 Have you not seen a vain vision, and spoken a lying divination: and you say: The Lord saith: whereas I have not spoken.
\p
\v 8 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have spoken vain things, and have seen lies: therefore, behold I come against you, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 9 And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.
\p
\v 10 Because they have deceived my people, saying: Peace, and there is no peace: and the people built up a wall, and they daubed it with dirt without straw.
\p
\v 11 Say to them that daub without tempering, that it shall fall: for there shall be an overflowing shower, and I will cause great hailstones to fall violently from above, and a stormy wind to throw it down.
\p
\v 12 Behold, when the wall is fallen: shall it not be said to you: Where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it?
\p
\v 13 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Lo, I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in my indignation, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger: and great hailstones in my wrath to consume.
\p
\v 14 And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar: and I will make it even with the ground, and the foundation thereof shall be laid bare: and it shall fall, and shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 15 And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that daub it without tempering the mortar, and I will say to you: The wall is no more, and they that daub it are no more.
\p
\v 16 Even the prophets of Israel that prophesy to Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her: and there is no peace, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 17 And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people that prophesy out of their own heart: and do thou prophesy against them.
\p
\v 18 And say: Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to them that sew cushions under every elbow: and make pillows for the heads of persons of every age to catch souls: and when they caught the souls of my people, they gave life to their souls.
\p
\v 19 And they violated me among my people, for a handful of barley, and a piece of bread, to kill souls which should not die, and to save souls alive which should not live, telling lies to my people that believe lies.
\p
\v 20 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I declare against your cushions, wherewith you catch flying souls: and I will tear them off from your arms; and I will let go the souls that you catch, the souls that should fly.
\p
\v 21 And I will tear your pillows, and will deliver my people out of your hand, neither shall they be any more in your hands to be a prey: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 22 Because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn, whom I have not made sorrowful; and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his evil way, and live.
\p
\v 23 Therefore, you shall not see vain things, nor divine divinations any more, and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and you shall know that I am the Lord.

\p
\v 4 Therefore, speak to them, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Every man of the house of Israel, that shall place his uncleannesses in his heart, and set up the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and shall come to the prophet, enquiring of me by him: I the Lord will answer him, according to the multitude of his uncleannesses.
\p

\p
\v 7 For every man of the house of Israel, and every stranger among the proselytes in Israel, if he separate himself from me, and place his idols in his heart, and set the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and come to the prophet to enquire of me by him: I the Lord will answer him by myself.
\p
\v 8 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example, and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the Lord.

\p
\v 13 Son of man, when a land shall sin against me, so as to transgress grievously, I will stretch forth my hand upon it, *and will break the staff of the bread thereof: and I will send famine upon it, and will destroy man and beast out of it.
\p
\v 14 And if these three men, Noe, Daniel, and Job, shall be in it: they shall deliver their own souls by their justice, saith the Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 15 And if I shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to waste it; and it be desolate, so that there is none that can pass because of the beasts:
\p
\v 16 If these three men shall be in it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters: but they only shall be delivered, and the land shall be made desolate.
\p
\v 17 Or if I bring the sword upon that land, and say to the sword: Pass through the land: and I destroy man and beast out of it:
\p
\v 18 And these three men be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they themselves alone shall be delivered.
\p
\v 19 Or if I also send the pestilence upon that land, and pour out my indignation upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
\p
\v 20 And Noe, and Daniel, and Job, be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter: but they shall only deliver their own souls by their justice.
\p
\v 21 For thus saith the Lord: Although I shall send in upon Jerusalem my four grievous judgments, the sword and the famine, and the mischievous beasts, and the pestilence, to destroy out of it man and beast:
\p
\v 22 Yet there shall be left in it some that shall be saved, who shall bring away their sons and daughters: behold they shall come among you, and you shall see their way, and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, in all things that I have brought upon it.

\cd As a vine cut down is fit for nothing but the fire: so it shall be with Jerusalem, for her sins.
\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, what shall be made of the wood of the vine, out of all the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests?
\p
\v 3 Shall wood be taken of if, to do any work, or shall a pin be made of it, for any vessel to hang thereon?
\p
\v 4 Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath consumed both ends thereof, and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes: shall it be useful for any work?
\p
\v 5 Even when it was whole it was not fit for work, how much less, when the fire hath devoured, and consumed it, shall any work be made of it?
\p
\v 6 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 7 And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from fire, and fire shall consume them: and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have set my face against them.
\p
\v 8 And I shall have made their land a wilderness, and desolate, because they have been transgressors, saith the Lord God.

(Calmet) --- The wild vine (Sanctius) grows very large, and the wood is durable, so that statues, pillars, and ladders were formed of it. (Pliny, [Natural History?] 14:1.) --- Strabo (ii., and xi.) mentions the trunk of a vine which two men could hardly clasp, and the bunch of grapes was two cubits high. But the prophet speaks of the small branches, which are fit only for the fire. (Calmet) --- God's Church is often compared to a vine on account of its fruit, and the branches separated form her resemble the useless cuttings. (St. Augustine, tr. lxxxi. in John) (Worthington) --- See Ward's Tree of Life, where this is set in a very striking light.

\cd Under the figure of an unfaithful wife, God upbraids Jerusalem with her ingratitude and manifold disloyalties: but promiseth mercy by a new covenant.
\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations:
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.
\p
\v 4 And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.
\p
\v 5 No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.
\p
\v 6 And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood: and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood: Live: yes, I said to thee: Live in thy blood.
\p
\v 7 I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field: and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman's ornament: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: and thou wast naked, and full of confusion.
\p
\v 8 And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold thy time was the time of lovers: and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy. And I swore to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God: and thou becamest mine.
\p
\v 9 And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee: and I anointed thee with oil.
\p
\v 10 And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shod thee with violet-coloured shoes: and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments.
\p
\v 11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck.
\p
\v 12 And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and ear-rings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
\p
\v 13 And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and embroidered work, and many colours: thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceedingly beautiful: and wast advanced to be a queen.
\p
\v 14 And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 15 But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his.
\p
\v 16 And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sowed together on each side: and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath not been done before, nor shall be hereafter.
\p
\v 17 And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my silver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of men, and hast committed fornication with them.
\p
\v 18 And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours, and coveredst them: and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them.
\p
\v 19 And my bread which I gave thee, the fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast set before them for a sweet odour; and it was done, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 20 And thou hast taken thy sons, and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me: and best sacrificed the same to them to be devoured. Is thy fornication small?
\p
\v 21 Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them, consecrating them by fire.
\p
\v 22 And after all thy abominations, and fornications, thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of confusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood.
\p
\v 23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (wo, wo to thee, saith the Lord God)
\p
\v 24 That thou didst also build thee a common stew, and madest thee a brothel house in every street.
\p
\v 25 At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution: and hast made thy beauty to be abominable: and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied thy fornications.
\p
\v 26 And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, men of large bodies, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me.
\p
\v 27 Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away thy justification: and I will deliver thee up to the will of the daughters of the Philistines that hate thee, that are ashamed of thy wicked way.
\p
\v 28 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast not yet satisfied: and after thou hadst played the harlot with them, even so thou wast not contented.
\p
\v 29 Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of Chanaan with the Chaldeans: and neither so wast thou satisfied.
\p
\v 30 Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith the Lord God: seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute?
\p
\v 31 Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way, and thou hast made thy high place in every street: and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price,
\p
\v 32 But as an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her husband.
\p
\v 33 Gifts are given to all harlots: but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side, to commit fornication with thee.
\p
\v 34 And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in thy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication: for in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the contrary hath been done in thee.
\p
\v 35 Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 36 Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with the idols of thy abominations by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them:
\p
\v 37 Behold, I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou hast hated: and I will gather them together against thee on every side, and will discover thy shame in their sight, and they shall see all thy nakedness.
\p
\v 38 *And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood are judged: and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
\p
\v 39 And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy thy brothel house, and throw down thy stews: and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty: and leave thee naked, and full of disgrace.
\p
\v 40 And they shall bring upon thee a multitude, and they shall stone thee with stones, and shall slay thee with their swords.
\p
\v 41 *And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and thou shalt cease from fornication, and shalt give no hire any more.
\p
\v 42 And my indignation shall rest in thee: and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be angry no more.
\p
\v 43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things: wherefore I also have turned thy ways upon thy head, saith the Lord God, and I have not done according to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations.
\p
\v 44 Behold, every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this against thee, saying: As the mother was, so also is her daughter.
\p
\v 45 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that cast off her husband, and her children: and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off their husbands, and their children: your mother was a Cethite, and your father an Amorrhite.
\p
\v 46 And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom, and her daughters.
\p
\v 47 But neither hast thou walked in their ways, nor hast thou done a little less than they according to their wickednesses: thou hast done almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways.
\p
\v 48 As I live, saith the Lord God, thy sister Sodom herself, and her daughters, have not done as thou hast done, and thy daughters.
\p
\v 49 *Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance, and the idleness of her, and of her daughters: and they did not put forth their hand to the needy, and to the poor.
\p
\v 50 And they were lifted up, and committed abominations before me: and I took them away as thou hast seen.
\p
\v 51 And Samaria committed not half thy sins: but thou hast surpassed them with thy crimes, and hast justified thy sisters by all thy abominations which thou hast done.
\p
\v 52 Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion, thou that hast surpassed thy sisters with thy sins, doing more wickedly than they: for they are justified above thee, therefore be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, thou that hast justified thy sisters.
\p
\v 53 And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom with her daughters, and by bringing back Samaria, and her daughters: and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them.
\p
\v 54 That thou mayst bear thy shame, and mayst be confounded in all that thou hast done, comforting them.
\p
\v 55 And thy sister Sodom, and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and thou, and thy daughters shall return to your ancient state.
\p
\v 56 And Sodom, thy sister, was not heard of in thy mouth, in the day of thy pride,
\p
\v 57 Before thy malice was laid open: as it is at this time, making thee a reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all the daughters of Palestine round about thee, that encompass thee on all sides.
\p
\v 58 Thou hast borne thy wickedness, and thy disgrace, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 59 For thus saith the Lord God: I will deal with thee, as thou hast despised the oath, in breaking the covenant:
\p
\v 60 And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth: and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.
\p
\v 61 And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed: when thou shalt receive thy sisters thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
\p
\v 62 And I will establish my covenant with thee: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,
\p
\v 63 That thou mayst remember, and be confounded, and mayst no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.

\v 7 And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many feathers: and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards him, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
\p
\v 8 It was planted in a good ground upon many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large vine.
\p
\v 9 Say thou: Thus saith the Lord God: Shall it prosper then? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and strip off its fruit, and dry up all the branches it hath shot forth, and make it wither: and this without a strong arm, or many people, to pluck it up by the root?
\p
\v 10 Behold, it is planted: shall it prosper then? shall it not be dried up when the burning wind shall touch it, and shall it not wither in the furrows where it grew?
\p
\v 11 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 12 Say to the provoking house: Know you not what these things mean? Tell them: Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem: and he shall take away the king and the princes thereof, and carry them with him to Babylon.
\p
\v 13 And he shall take one of the king's seed, and make a covenant with him, and take an oath of him. Yea, and he shall take away the mighty men of the land.
\p
\v 14 That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up, but keep his covenant and observe it.
\p
\v 15 But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt, that it might give him horses, and much people. And shall he that hath done thus prosper, or be saved? and shall he escape that hath broken the covenant?
\p
\v 16 As I live, saith the Lord God: In the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he hath made void, and whose covenant he broke, even in the midst of Babylon shall he die.
\p
\v 17 And not with a great army, nor with much people shall Pharao fight against him: when he shall cast up mounts, and build forts, to cut off many souls.
\p
\v 18 For he had despised the oath, breaking his covenant, and behold he hath given his hand: and having done all these things, he shall not escape.
\p
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As I live, I will lay upon his head the oath he hath despised, and the covenant he hath broken.
\p
\v 20 *And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, and will judge him there for the transgression by which he hath despised me.
\p
\v 21 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword: and the residue shall be scattered into every wind: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken.
\p
\v 22 Thus saith the Lord God: I myself will take of the marrow of the high cedar, and will set it: I will crop off a tender twig from the top of the branches thereof, and I will plant it on a mountain high and eminent.
\p
\v 23 On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it, and it shall shoot forth into branches, and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a great cedar: and all birds shall dwell under it, and every fowl shall make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof.
\p
\v 24 And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and have dried up the green tree, and have caused the dry tree to flourish. I the Lord have spoken, and have done it.

\cd One man shall not bear the sins of another, but every one his own: if a wicked man truly repent, he shall be saved: and if a just man leave his justice, he shall perish.
\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What is the meaning
\p
\v 2 That you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of Israel, saying: *The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge?
\p
\v 3 As I live, saith the Lord God, this parable shall be no more to you a proverb in Israel.
\p
\v 4 Behold all souls are mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, the same shall die.
\p
\v 5 And if a man be just, and do judgment and justice,
\p
\v 6 And hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel: and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, nor come near to a menstruous woman:
\p
\v 7 And hath not wronged any man: but hath restored the pledge to the debtor, hath taken nothing away by violence: *hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment:
\p
\v 8 Hath not lent upon usury, nor taken any increase: hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, and hath executed true judgment between man and man:
\p
\v 9 Hath walked in my commandments, and kept my judgments, to do truth: he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 10 And if he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that hath done some one of these things:
\p
\v 11 Though he doth not all these things, but that eateth upon the mountains, and that defileth his neighbour's wife:
\p
\v 12 That grieveth the needy and the poor, that taketh away by violence, that restoreth not the pledge, and that lifteth up his eyes to idols, that committeth abomination:
\p
\v 13 That giveth upon usury, and that taketh an increase: shall such a one live? he shall not live. Seeing he hath done all these detestable things, he shall surely die, his blood shall be upon him.
\p
\v 14 But if he beget a son, who seeing all his father's sins, which he hath done, is afraid, and shall not do the like to them :
\p
\v 15 That hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife:
\p
\v 16 And hath not grieved any man, nor withholden the pledge, nor taken away with violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment:
\p
\v 17 That hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor, hath not taken usury and increase, but hath executed my judgments, and hath walked in my commandments: this man shall not die for the iniquity of his father, but living he shall live.
\p
\v 18 As for his father: because he oppressed, and offered violence to his brother, and wrought evil in the midst of his people, behold he is dead in his own iniquity.
\p
\v 19 And you say: Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father? Verily, because the son hath wrought judgment and justice, hath kept all my commandments, and done them, living he shall live.
\p
\v 20 *The soul that sinneth, the same shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
\p
\v 21 But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die.
\p
\v 22 I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done: in his justice which he hath wrought, he shall live.
\p
\v 23 *Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways, and live?
\p
\v 24 But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his sin which he hath committed, in them he shall die.
\p
\v 25 And you have said: *The way of the Lord is not right. Hear ye, therefore, O house of Israel: Is it my way that is not right, and are not rather your ways perverse?
\p
\v 26 For when the just turneth himself away from his justice, and committeth iniquity, he shall die therein: in the injustice that he hath wrought he shall die.
\p
\v 27 And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doth judgment, and justice: he shall save his soul alive.
\p
\v 28 Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live, and not die.
\p
\v 29 And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not right. Are not my ways right, O house of Israel, and are not rather your ways perverse?
\p
\v 30 Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God.* Be converted, and do penance for all your iniquities: and iniquity shall not be your ruin.
\p
\v 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart, and a new spirit: and why will you die, O house of Israel?
\p

(Haydock) --- God seems to allow that the complaints had hitherto had some grounds, (Jeremias xxxi.) but that they should be removed after the captivity, and still more effectually by the death of Christ, who came to redeem sinners, and rejected none. By baptism he cancels original sin, the sour grape, and those who cannot receive it are not innocent.

\f + \fr 18:21\ft Penance. The end determines all. If a person be then found just or unjust at his departure, he will be treated accordingly. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 18:23\ft Will. God sincerely wishes that the sinner should be converted. If he refuse grace, it is only in punishment of former transgressions. (St. Augustine, ep. 217.) --- He wills antecedently their salvation, (1 Timothy 2:4.) though he has a consequent will to punish them, as they speak in the schools, because they themselves will not be saved. (Sanctius) (Calmet) --- God's absolute will is always fulfilled, not that which is conditional. (St. John Damascene, Fide 2:29.; St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae p. 1. q. 19. a. 6.) --- He does enough by offering his graces and the death of Christ, to shew that his will is sincere; though by a consequent will his justice punishes the impenitent. Thus a virtuous judge would have all to observe the laws and live: but finding some transgress, so as to become pernicious, he punishes them with death. (Worthington)\f*

\cd God refuses to answer the ancients of Israel, inquiring by the prophet: but by him setteth his benefits before their eyes, and their heinous sins: threatening yet greater punishments, but still mixt with mercy.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, there came men of the ancients of Israel to inquire of the Lord; and they sat before me.
\p
\v 2 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 3 Son of man, speak to the ancients of Israel, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Are you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not answer you, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 4 If thou judgest them, if thou judgest, O son of man, declare to them the abominations of their fathers.
\p
\v 5 And say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand for the race of the house of Jacob: and appeared to them in the land of Egypt, and lifted up my hand for them, saying: I am the Lord your God:
\p
\v 6 In that day I lifted up my hand for them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt, into a land which I had provided for them, flowing with milk and honey, which excelleth amongst all lands.
\p
\v 7 And I said to them: Let every man cast away the scandals of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
\p
\v 8 But they provoked me, and would not hearken to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of his eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: and I said I would pour out my indignation upon them, and accomplish my wrath against them, in the midst of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 9 But I did otherwise for my name's sake, that it might not be violated before the nations, in the midst of whom they were, and among whom I made myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 10 Therefore I brought them out from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the desert.
\p
\v 11 *And I gave them my statutes, and I shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them.
\p
\v 12 *Moreover, I gave them also my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them: and that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.
\p
\v 13 But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my judgments, which if a man do he shall live in them: and they grievously violated my sabbaths. I said, therefore, that I would pour out my indignation upon them in the desert, and would consume them.
\p
\v 14 But I spared them for the sake of my name, lest it should be profaned before the nations, from which I brought them out in their sight.
\p
\v 15 So I lifted up my hand over them in the desert, not to bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the best of all lands.
\p
\v 16 Because they cast off my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, and violated my sabbaths: for their heart went after idols.
\p
\v 17 Yet my eye spared them, so that I destroyed them not: neither did I consume them in the desert.
\p
\v 18 And I said to their children in the wilderness: Walk not in the statutes of your fathers, and observe not their judgments, nor be ye defiled with their idols:
\p
\v 19 I am the Lord your God: walk ye in my statutes, and observe my judgments, and do them.
\p
\v 20 And sanctify my sabbaths, that they may be a sign between me and you: and that you may know that I am the Lord your God.
\p
\v 21 But their children provoked me, they walked not in my commandments, nor observed my judgments, to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them: and they violated my sabbaths: and I threatened to pour out my indignation upon them, and to accomplish my wrath in them in the desert.
\p
\v 22 But I turned away my hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it might not be violated before the nations, out of which I brought them forth in their sight.
\p
\v 23 Again I lifted up my hand upon them in the wilderness, to disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries:
\p
\v 24 Because they had not done my judgments, and had cast off my statutes, and had violated my sabbaths, and their eyes had been after the idols of their fathers.
\p
\v 25 Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments, in which they shall not live.
\p
\v 26 And I polluted them in their own gifts, when they offered all that opened the womb, for their offences: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 27 Wherefore speak to the house of Israel, O son of man, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Moreover, in this also your fathers blasphemed me, when they had despised and contemned me:
\p
\v 28 And I had brought them into the land, for which I lifted up my hand to give it them: they saw every high hill, and every shady tree, and there they sacrificed their victims, and there they presented the provocation of their offerings, and there they set their sweet odours, and poured forth their libations.
\p
\v 29 And I said to them: What meaneth the high place to which you go? and the name thereof was called high-place even to this day.
\p
\v 30 Wherefore say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Verily, you are defiled in the way of your fathers, and you commit fornication with their abominations.
\p
\v 31 And you defile yourselves with all your idols unto this day, in the offering of your gifts, when you make your children pass through the fire: and shall I answer you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not answer you.
\p
\v 32 Neither shall the thought of your mind come to pass, by which you say: We will be as the Gentiles, and as the families of the earth, to worship stocks and stones.
\p
\v 33 As I live, saith the Lord God, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
\p
\v 34 And I will bring you out from the people, and I will gather you out of the countries, in which you are scattered, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
\p
\v 35 And I will bring you into the wilderness of people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
\p
\v 36 As I pleaded against your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt: even so will I judge you, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 37 And I will make you subject to my sceptre, and will bring you into the bands of the covenant.
\p
\v 38 And I will pick out from among you the transgressors, and the wicked, and will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 39 And as for you, O house of Israel: thus saith the Lord God: Walk ye every one after your idols, and serve them. But if in this also you hear me not, but defile my holy name any more with your gifts, and with your idols.
\p
\v 40 In my holy mountain, in the high mountain of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel serve me: all of them, I say, in the land in which they shall please me, and there will I require your first fruits, and the chief of your tithes, with all your sanctifications.
\p
\v 41 I will accept of you for an odour of sweetness, when I shall have brought you out from the people, and shall have gathered you out of the lands into which you are scattered, and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.
\p
\v 42 And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have brought you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
\p
\v 43 And there you shall remember your ways, and all your wicked doings with which you have been defiled: and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight, for all your wicked deeds which you committed.
\p
\v 44 And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have done well by you for my own name's sake, and not according to your evil ways, nor according to your wicked deeds, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 45 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying :
\p
\v 46 Son of man, set thy face against the way of the south, and drop towards the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.
\p
\v 47 And any to the south forest: Hear the word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will kindle a fire in thee, and will burn in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the flame of the fire shall not be quenched: and every face shall be burned in it, from the south even to the north.
\p
\v 48 And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord have kindled it, and it shall not be quenched.
\p
\v 49 And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God: they say of me: Doth not this man speak by parables?

\f + \fr 20:1\ft Month: the year of the world 3411, August 27. (Usher) --- Ezechiel had prophesied in the fourth year; then was silent a year and two months, or 430 days. He opened his mouth again in the sixth year, (chap. 8:1.) and now in the seventh year he is ordered not to answer. (Worthington) --- We know not what the ancients wanted to know; but their design was evil. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:4\ft Judgest them; or, if thou wilt enter into the cause, and plead against them. (Challoner) --- Lay before them the iniquities of their fathers, and their own, which bring on the reprobation of the greatest part. God will form his Church out of a few of them and of the Gentiles. The return of a small number from captivity is also insinuated.\f*
\f + \fr 20:6\ft Excelleth. Hebrew, "is beauty or a desire." Septuagint, "a honeycomb." (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:7\ft Scandals, etc., (offensiones) that is, the abominations or idols, to the worship of which they were allured by their eyes. (Challoner) --- Moses found them in this condition in Egypt, and he could not entirely reclaim them. (Calmet) --- Many still secreted their idols, Ezechiel 23:1., and Acts 7:42. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 20:8\ft Egypt. Their disorders called for such severity. But God was restrained by the dangers (Calmet) of blasphemy, etc., to which the faithful and idolaters would thus have been exposed. (Haydock) --- He saved them as he had promised, though they did not deserve it. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 20:10\ft Brought. Literally, "cast," (Haydock) as if they had been reluctant.\f*
\f + \fr 20:11\ft Live, and enjoy temporal felicity, which was chiefly promised, though the faithful observers of the law would obtain an eternal reward.\f*
\f + \fr 20:12\ft Sign, as also to promote piety and instruction.\f*
\f + \fr 20:13\ft Sabbaths. We only read of one man gathering sticks, and the people manna once on those days, Exodus xv., and xvi. But Moses does not mention all. (Calmet) --- Sabbath often denotes the whole law, which they transgressed; and as long as they retained an affection for idols, they could not observe the sabbaths so as to please God.\f*
\f + \fr 20:14\ft But. Literally, "And I did for," etc. This motive caused me to spare them. (Haydock) --- I punished only the most guilty adorers of the calf, and murmurers, etc., Numbers 14:28. (Calmet) --- Some were always preserved for a succession, ver. 9, 22. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 20:23\ft Again, or also. (Haydock) --- Four times are specified [in] ver. 13, 15, 21., which may allude to the adoration of the calf, the graves of concupiscence, the murmuring, and commerce with the women and idols of Moab, Exodus xxiii., and Numbers x., and xiv., and xxv. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:25\ft Not good. The laws and ordinances of their enemies: or those imposed upon them by that cruel tyrant the devil, to whose power they were delivered up for their sins; (Challoner) which may be styled the statutes of your fathers, etc., ver. 18. (Haydock) --- God is often said to do what he only permits. (Calmet) --- He abandoned them to their own perversity. (St. Jerome) (Deuteronomy 32:21, 37.) --- If God had spoken of the Decalogue, etc., would he say such laws were not good, after he had testified that the observers shall live in them? ver. 11. He established the ceremonial law, at the same time. See Kimchi; Menochius, etc. Chaldean, "I have given them up to their foolish desires. They have established bad statutes and laws which will not give them life." This seems the best explanation. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "Have I given....(26) and have I polluted them?" etc. (Manasse Ben. Israel.) The precepts had also a bad effect, and were given in condescension to the weakness of the people, (Origen) particularly the ceremonial part. (St. Just.[St. Justin Martyr?]; St. Chrysostom; St. Jerome, etc.) --- They did not justify, (St. Augustine) and were not good, compared with those of the new law. (St. Gregory, mor. 28:9.) --- Thus Solon gave the Athenians "the best laws that they would receive," (Plutarch) though others more perfect might have been devised. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:26\ft I polluted them, etc. That is, I gave them up to such blindness, in punishment of their offences, as to pollute themselves with the blood of all their first-born, whom they offered up to their idols in compliance with their wicked devices. (Challoner) (Menochius) (Leviticus 18:21., and 4 Kings 3:ultra[last verse], and 21:6. (Calmet) --- Offered. Protestants, "caused to pass through the fire all,["] etc., Ezechiel 16:21. --- For their. Protestants, "that I might make them desolate to the end, that," etc.\f*
\f + \fr 20:29\ft Called high. Hebrew, "Bamah," (Haydock) out of contempt. (Calmet) --- The Jews were so much attached to the high places, that they called the altar of the Lord by the same name. Thus heretics are convicted by the very names they use, calling sacrifice service, etc. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 20:32\ft Stones. This was the secret intention of the ancients, (ver. 1.; Haydock) and of many in captivity, who were only praise-worthy compared with those at Jerusalem, Ezechiel 11:15.\f*
\f + \fr 20:33\ft Out. I will not allow you to follow idols with impunity. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:35\ft Of people. That is, a desert, in which there are no people; (Challoner) meaning Judea, to which they should return.\f*
\f + \fr 20:37\ft Covenant of the gospel, by the powerful attractions of grace, Luke 14:24., John 6:69., and 7:46., and 2 Corinthians 10:4.\f*
\f + \fr 20:38\ft Israel. They shall continue in exile; or the rebel Jews who will not believe in Christ, shall be cast off. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:39\ft Walk, etc. It is not an allowance, much less a commandment to serve idols; but a figure of speech, by which God would have them to understand, that if they would walk after their idols, they must not pretend to serve him at the same time: for that he would by no means suffer such a mixture of worship. (Challoner) (St. Jerome) --- Continue, if you dare, to serve idols. I will still bring you back. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "take away each your devices; and then if you hear me, (Grabe's copy adds, not) and defile not my," etc. (Haydock) --- God would rather have idolaters leave him wholly, than halt between two, (3 Kings xviii.) neither hot nor cold; (Apocalypse iii.) for such dishonour God's name the most, Romans 2:24. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 20:40\ft Mountain. The foregoing verse, to make the sense complete, must be understood so as to condemn and reject that mixture of worship which the Jews then followed. In this verse God promises to the true Israelites, especially to those of the Christian Church, that they should serve him in another manner in his holy mountain, the spiritual Sion, and shall be accepted of by him. (Challoner)\f*
\f + \fr 20:43\ft Committed. This is a picture of the converts to Christianity. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 20:46\ft Of the south. Jerusalem lay towards the south of Babylon, where the prophet then was, and is here called the forest of the south field, and is threatened with utter desolation. (Challoner) See Ezechiel 21. (Calmet) --- In Jerusalem there were good and bad. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 20:47\ft Burned, with war and famine, Jeremias 21:14. (Calmet) --- North, from Egypt to Mesopotamia. (Theodoret) --- Nabuchodonosor invaded those parts. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 20:49\ft Parables. They were easy enough to understand, but the Jews would not comprehend them no more than our Saviour's words, John 10:24. (Calmet) --- Much of this prophecy was so hard, that all seemed to be parables. (Worthington)\f*

\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and let thy speech flow towards the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel:
\p
\v 3 And say to the land of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off in thee the just, and the wicked.
\p
\v 4 And forasmuch as I have cut off in thee the just, and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south even to the north.
\p
\v 5 That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath, not to be turned back.
\p
\v 6 And thou, son of man, mourn with the breaking of thy loins, and with bitterness sigh before them.
\p
\v 7 And when they shall say to thee: Why mournest thou? thou shalt say: For that which I hear: because it cometh, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be made feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and water shall run down every knee: behold it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 8 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 9 Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Say: The sword, the sword is sharpened, and furbished.
\p
\v 10 It is sharpened to kill victims: it is furbished that it may glitter: thou removest the sceptre of my son, thou hast cut down every tree.
\p
\v 11 And I have given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, that it may be in the hand of the slayer.
\p
\v 12 Cry, and howl, O son of man, for this sword is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel, that are fled: they are delivered up to the sword with my people; strike, therefore, upon thy thigh,
\p
\v 13 Because it is tried: and that, when it shall overthrow the sceptre, and it shall not be, saith the Lord God:
\p
\v 14 Thou, therefore, O son of man, prophesy, and strike thy hands together, and let the sword be doubled, and let the sword of the slain be tripled: this is the sword of a great slaughter, that maketh them stand amazed,
\p
\v 15 And languish in heart, and that multiplieth ruins. In all their gates I have set the dread of the sharp sword, the sword that is furbished to glitter, that is made ready for slaughter.
\p
\v 16 Be thou sharpened, go to the right hand, or to the left, which way soever thou hast a mind to set thy face.
\p
\v 17 And I will clap my hands together, and will satisfy my indignation: I the Lord have spoken.
\p
\v 18 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 19 And thou, son of man, set thee two ways, for the sword of the king of Babylon to come: both shall come forth out of one land: and with his hand he shall draw lots, he shall consult at the head of the way of the city.
\p
\v 20 Thou shalt make a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and to Juda, unto Jerusalem, the strong city.
\p
\v 21 For the king of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking divination, shuffling arrows: he enquired of the idols, and consulted entrails.
\p
\v 22 On his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in slaughter, to lift up the voice in howling, to set engines against the gates, to cast up a mount, to build forts.
\p
\v 23 And he shall be in their eyes as one consulting the oracle in vain, and imitating the leisure of sabbaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
\p
\v 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have remembered your iniquity, and have discovered your prevarications, and your sins have appeared in all your devices: because, I say, you have remembered, you shall be taken with the hand.
\p
\v 25 But thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come that hath been appointed in the time of iniquity:
\p
\v 26 Thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem, take off the crown: is it not this that hath exalted the low one, and brought down him that was high?
\p
\v 27 I will shew it to be iniquity, iniquity, iniquity: but this was not done, till he came to whom judgment belongeth, and I will give it him.
\p
\v 28 *And thou son of man prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach, and thou shalt say: O sword, O sword, come out of the scabbard to kill, be furbished to destroy, and to glitter.
\p
\v 29 Whilst they see vain things in thy regard, and they divine lies; to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded, whose appointed day is come in the time of iniquity.
\p
\v 30 Return into thy sheath. I will judge thee in the place wherein thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
\p
\v 31 And I will pour out upon thee my indignation: in the fire of my rage will I blow upon thee, and will give thee into the hands of men that are brutish and contrive thy destruction.
\p
\v 32 Thou shalt be fuel for the fire, thy blood shall be in the midst of the land, thou shalt be forgotten; for I, the Lord, have spoken it.

He was undetermined which to attack first, and perhaps wrote Jerusalem on one and Rabbath on another arrow; (St. Jerome, etc.; Calmet) or which way the arrow fell the army followed. (Haydock) --- Many nations have adopted such superstitious practices. --- Idols. Hebrew Teraphim, Genesis 31:19. (Calmet) --- Entrails. The Chaldeans taught the Lydians and they the Tuscans.

(Calmet) --- If they had attacked Rabbath first, they would probably have succeeded, as they did five years after. But the time of vengeance was come for Jerusalem, (Haydock) and they were directed to assault it. (Worthington) --- Voice: the din of war, (Haydock) or of soldiers, trumpets, etc.\f*

\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, *saying:
\p
\v 2 And thou son of man, dost thou not judge, dost thou not judge the city of blood?
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt shew her all her abominations, and shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God: This is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come: and that hath made idols against herself, to defile herself.
\p
\v 4 Thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed: and thou art defiled in thy idols which thou hast made: and thou hast made thy days to draw near, and hast brought on the time of thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles, and a mockery to all countries.
\p
\v 5 Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall triumph over thee: thou filthy one, infamous, great in destruction.
\p
\v 6 Behold the princes of Israel, every one hath employed his arm in thee, to shed blood.
\p
\v 7 They have abused father and mother in thee; they have oppressed the stranger in the midst of thee; they have grieved the fatherless and widow in thee.
\p
\v 8 Thou hast despised my sanctuaries, and profaned my sabbaths.
\p
\v 9 Slanderers have been in thee to shed blood, and they have eaten upon the mountains in thee, they have committed wickedness in the midst of thee.
\p
\v 10 They have discovered the nakedness of their father in thee, they have humbled the uncleanness of the menstruous woman in thee.
\p
\v 11 *And every one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife, and the father-in-law hath wickedly defiled his daughter-in-law, the brother hath oppressed his sister, the daughter of his father, in thee.
\p

\v 13 Behold, I have clapped my hands at thy covetousness, which thou hast exercised; and at the blood that hath been shed in the midst of thee.

\cd Under the name of the two harlots, Oolla and Ooliba, are described the manifold disloyalties of Samaria and Jerusalem, with the punishment of them both.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, *saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:
\p
\v 3 And they committed fornication in Egypt, in their youth they committed fornication: there were their breasts pressed down, and the teats of their virginity were bruised.
\p
\v 4 And their names were Oolla, the elder, and Ooliba, her younger sister: and I took them, and they bore sons and daughters. Now for their names: Samaria is Oolla, and Jerusalem is Ooliba.
\p
\v 5 And Oolla committed fornication against me, and doated on her lovers, on the Assyrians that came to her.
\p
\v 6 Who were clothed with blue, princes, and rulers, beautiful youths, all horsemen, mounted upon horses.
\p
\v 7 And she committed her fornications with those chosen men, all sons of the Assyrians: and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of all them on whom she doated.
\p
\v 8 Moreover also, she did not forsake her fornications which she had committed in Egypt: for they also lay with her in her youth, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured out their fornication upon her.
\p
\v 9 Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of the Assyrians, upon whose lust she doated.
\p
\v 10 *They discovered her disgrace, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and they became infamous women, and they executed judgments in her.
\p
\v 11 And when her sister, Ooliba, saw this, she was mad with lust more than she: and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her sister.
\p
\v 12 Impudently prostituting herself to the children of the Assyrians, the princes, and rulers that came to her, clothed with divers colours, to the horsemen that rode upon horses, and to young men, all of great beauty.
\p
\v 13 And I saw that she was defiled, and that they both took one way.
\p
\v 14 And she increased her fornications: and when she had seen men painted on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours,
\p
\v 15 And girded with girdles about their reins, and with dyed turbans on their heads, the resemblance of all the captains, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, and of the land of the Chaldeans, wherein they were born.
\p
\v 16 She doated upon them with the lust of her eyes, and she sent messengers to them into Chaldea.
\p
\v 17 And when the sons of Babylon were come to her to the bed of love, they defiled her with their fornications, and she was polluted by them, and her soul was glutted with them.
\p
\v 18 And she discovered her fornications, and discovered her disgrace: and my soul was alienated from her as my soul was alienated from her sister.
\p
\v 19 For she multiplied her fornications, remembering the days of her youth, in which she played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 20 And she was mad with lust after lying with them, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses: and whose issue as the issue of horses.
\p
\v 21 And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth, when thy breasts were pressed in Egypt, and the paps of thy virginity broken.
\p
\v 22 Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will raise up against thee all thy lovers, with whom thy soul hath been glutted: and I will gather them together against thee round about.
\p
\v 23 The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, the nobles, and the kings, and princes, all the sons of the Assyrians, beautiful young men, all the captains, and rulers, the princes of princes, and the renowned horsemen.
\p
\v 24 And they shall come upon thee well appointed with chariot and wheel, a multitude of people: they shall be armed against thee on every side with breastplate, and buckler, and helmet: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee by their judgments.
\p
\v 25 And I will set my jealousy against thee, which they shall execute upon thee, with fury: they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears: and what remains shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons, and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by fire.
\p
\v 26 And they shall strip thee of thy garments, and take away the instruments of thy glory.
\p
\v 27 And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee, and thy fornication brought out of the land of Egypt: neither shalt thou lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.
\p
\v 28 For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou hatest, into their hands with whom thy soul hath been glutted.
\p
\v 29 And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and they shall take away all thy labours, and shall let thee go naked, and full of disgrace, and the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discovered, thy wickedness, and thy fornications.
\p
\v 30 They have done these things to thee, because thou hast played the harlot with the nations among which thou wast defiled with their idols.
\p
\v 31 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, and I will give her cup into thy hand.
\p
\v 32 Thus saith the Lord God: Thou shalt drink thy sister's cup, deep, and wide: thou shalt be had in derision and scorn, which containeth very much.
\p
\v 33 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness, and sorrow: with the cup of grief, and sadness, with the cup of thy sister, Samaria.
\p
\v 34 And thou shalt drink it, and shalt drink it up even to the dregs, and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof, thou shalt rend thy breasts: because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 35 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast forgotten me, and hast cast me off behind thy back, bear thou also thy wickedness, and thy fornications.
\p
\v 36 And the Lord spoke to me, saying: Son of man, dost thou judge Oolla, and Ooliba, and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds?
\p
\v 37 Because they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and they have committed fornication with their idols: moreover also their children, whom they bore to me, they have offered to them to be devoured.
\p
\v 38 Yea, and they have done this to me. They polluted my sanctuary on the same day, and profaned my sabbaths.
\p
\v 39 And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, and went into my sanctuary the same day, to profane it: they did these things even in the midst of my house.
\p
\v 40 They sent for men coming from afar, to whom they had sent a messenger: and behold they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, and didst paint thy eyes, and wast adorned with women's ornaments.
\p
\v 41 Thou sattest on a very fine bed, and a table was decked before thee: whereupon thou didst set my incense and my ointment.
\p
\v 42 And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing: and to some that were brought of the multitude of men, and that came from the desert, they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.
\p
\v 43 And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries: Now will this woman still continue in her fornication.
\p
\v 44 And they went in to her, as to a harlot: so went they in unto Oolla, and Ooliba, wicked women.
\p
\v 45 They, therefore, are just men: these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as shedders of blood are judged: because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
\p
\v 46 For thus saith the Lord God: Bring a multitude upon them, and deliver them over to tumult and rapine:
\p
\v 47 And let the people stone them with stones, and let them be stabbed with their swords: they shall kill their sons and daughters, and their houses they shall burn with fire.
\p
\v 48 And I will take away wickedness out of the land: and all women shall learn, not to do according to the wickedness of them.
\p
\v 49 And they shall render your wickedness upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.

\cd Under the parable of a boiling pot, is shewn the utter destruction of Jerusalem: for which the Jews at Babylon shall not dare to mourn.
\p
\v 1 And *the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, write thee the name of this day, on which the king of Babylon hath set himself against Jerusalem to-day.
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt speak by a figure, a parable, to the provoking house, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Set on a pot, set it on, I say; and put water into it.
\p
\v 4 Heap together into it the pieces thereof, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder, choice pieces and full of bones.
\p
\v 5 Take the fattest of the flock, and lay together piles of bones under it: the seething thereof is boiling hot, and the bones thereof are thoroughly sodden in the midst of it.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Wo to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is in it, and its rust is not gone out of it: cast it out piece by piece, there hath no lot fallen upon it.
\p
\v 7 For her blood is in the midst of her, she hath shed it upon the smooth rock: she hath not shed it upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust.
\p
\v 8 And that I might bring my indignation upon her, and take my vengeance: I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock, that it should not be covered.
\p
\v 9 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: *Wo to the bloody city, of which I will make a great bonfire.
\p
\v 10 Heap together the bones, which I will burn with fire: the flesh shall be consumed, and the whole composition shall be sodden, and the bones shall be consumed.
\p
\v 11 Then set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of it be melted, in the midst thereof, and let the rust of it be consumed.
\p
\v 12 Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, not even by fire.
\p
\v 13 Thy uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness: neither shalt thou be cleansed, before I cause my indignation to rest in thee.
\p
\v 14 I, the Lord, have spoken: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not pass by, nor spare, nor be pacified: I will judge thee according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, saith the Lord.
\p
\v 15 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 16 Son of man, behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke: and thou shalt not lament, nor weep: neither shall thy tears run down.
\p
\v 17 Sigh in silence; make no mourning for the dead: let the tire of thy head be upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet, and cover not thy face, nor eat the meat of mourners.
\p
\v 18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening: and I did in the morning as he had commanded me.
\p
\v 19 And the people said to me: Why dost thou not tell us what these things mean that thou dost?
\p
\v 20 And I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 21 Speak to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the glory of your realm, and the thing that your eyes desire, and for which your soul feareth: your sons and your daughters, whom you have left, shall fall by the sword.
\p
\v 22 And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your faces, nor shall you eat the meat of mourners.
\p
\v 23 You shall have crowns on your heads, and shoes on your feet; you shall not lament nor weep, but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and every one shall sigh with his brother.
\p
\v 24 And Ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come: according to all that he hath done, so shall you do, when this shall come to pass: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.
\p
\v 25 And thou, O son of man, behold in the day wherein I will take away from them their strength, and the joy of their glory, and the desire of their eyes, upon which their souls rest, their sons and their daughters.
\p
\v 26 In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee, to tell thee;
\p
\v 27 In that day, I say, shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and shalt be silent no more: and thou shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come: and you shall know that I am the Lord.

\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against the children of Ammon, and thou shalt prophesy of them.
\p
\v 3 *And thou shalt say to the children of Ammon: Hear ye the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast said, Ha, ha, upon my sanctuary, because it was profaned; and upon the land of Israel, because it was laid waste; and upon the house of Juda, because they are led into captivity:
\p
\v 4 Therefore, will I deliver thee to the men of the east for an inheritance, and they shall place their sheepcotes in thee, and shall set up their tents in thee: they shall eat thy fruits, and they shall drink thy milk.
\p
\v 5 And I will make Rabbath a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 6 For thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with thy foot, and hast rejoiced with all thy heart against the land of Israel;
\p
\v 7 Therefore, behold, I will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee to be the spoil of nations, and will cut thee off from among the people, and destroy thee out of the lands, and break thee in pieces: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 8 Thus saith the Lord God: Because Moab and Seir have said: Behold, the house of Juda is like all other nations:
\p
\v 9 Therefore, behold, I will open the shoulder of Moab from the cities, from his cities, I say, and his borders, the noble cities of the land of Bethiesimoth, and Beelmeon, and Cariathaim,
\p
\v 10 To the people of the east with the children of Ammon, and I will give it them for an inheritance, that there may be no more any remembrance of the children of Ammon among the nations.
\p
\v 11 And I will execute judgments in Moab: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\p

\v 16 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will stretch forth my hand upon the Philistines, and will kill the killers, and will destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
\p
\v 17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them, rebuking them in fury: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

\cd A prophecy of the destruction of the famous city of Tyre by Nabuchodonosor.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass in the eleventh year, the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, because Tyre hath said of Jerusalem: Aha, the gates of the people are broken, she is turned to me: I shall be filled, now she is laid waste.
\p
\v 3 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, O Tyre, and I will cause many nations to come up to thee, as the waves of the sea rise up.
\p
\v 4 And they shall break down the walls of Tyre, and destroy the towers thereof: and I will scrape her dust from her, and make her like a smooth rock.
\p
\v 5 She shall be a drying-place for nets in the midst of the sea, because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God: and she shall be a spoil to the nations.
\p
\v 6 Her daughters also that are in the field, shall be slain by the sword: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 7 For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will bring against Tyre Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, the king of kings, from the north, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and companies, and much people.
\p
\v 8 Thy daughters that are in the field, he shall kill with the sword: and he shall compass thee with forts, and shall cast up a mount round about: and he shall lift up the buckler against thee.
\p
\v 9 And he shall set engines of war and battering rams against thy walls, and shall destroy thy towers with his arms.
\p
\v 10 By reason of the multitude of his horses, their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, when they shall go in at thy gates, as by the entrance of a city that is destroyed.
\p
\v 11 With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets: thy people he shall kill with the sword: and thy famous statues shall fall to the ground.
\p
\v 12 They shall waste thy riches, they shall make a spoil of thy merchandise: and they shall destroy thy walls, and pull down thy fine houses: and they shall lay thy stones, and thy timber, and thy dust, in the midst of the waters.
\p
\v 13 *And I will make the multitude of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be heard no more.
\p
\v 14 And I will make thee like a naked rock, thou shalt be a drying place for nets, neither shalt thou be built any more: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the islands shake at the sound of thy fall, and the groans of thy slain, when they shall be killed in the midst of thee?
\p
\v 16 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones: and take off their robes, and cast away their broidered garments, and be clothed with astonishment: they shall sit on the ground, and with amazement shall wonder at thy sudden fall.
\p
\v 17 And taking up a lamentation over thee, they shall say to thee: How art thou fallen, that dwellest in the sea, renowned city, that wast strong in the sea, with thy inhabitants, whom all did dread?
\p
\v 18 Now shall the ships be astonished in the day of thy terror: and the islands in the sea shall be troubled, because no one cometh out of thee.
\p
\v 19 For thus saith the Lord God: When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited: and shall bring the deep upon thee, and many waters shall cover thee:
\p
\v 20 And when I shall bring thee down with those that descend into the pit to the everlasting people, and shall set thee in the lowest parts of the earth, as places desolate of old, with them that are brought down into the pit, that thou be not inhabited: and when I shall give glory in the land of the living,
\p
\v 21 I will bring thee to nothing, and thou shalt not be, and if thou be sought for, thou shalt not be found any more for ever, saith the Lord God.

\f + \fr 26:1\ft Year of the prophet's captivity. (Haydock) --- He still dates from the transmigration of Joachin, Ezechiel 1. (Worthington) --- Some think he speaks of the first, fourth, or fifth month. Tyre was not besieged till after the ninth day of the fourth month, when Jerusalem was taken; nor could she express her joy for that event before, unless God allude to her dispositions, etc., Ezechiel 25:1. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 26:2\ft Gates: places of resort and commerce. The Jews came to Jerusalem frequently from all parts, which increased her beauty and trade. New Tyre expects that more will come to her.\f*
\f + \fr 26:3\ft Up. Nabuchodonosor besieged the city for thirteen years. The profane historians read by St. Jerome took no notice of this; but Josephus quotes several. (Antiquities 10:11., and contra Apion i.) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 26:4\ft Dust. She shall be demolished, and the rubbish thrown into the sea, to make a road by which New Tyre in the island might be attacked, ver. 12. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 26:5\ft Sea. St. Jerome explains this of New Tyre; Marsham of the Old. To reconcile the different texts, we only need to suppose that both cities were connected by a road thrown up in the sea by Hiram, and repaired by Nabuchodonosor with great labour, (chap. 29:18.) after it had been destroyed by the inhabitants of New Tyre, when they saw the old city on the continent fall a prey. (St. Jerome) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 26:7\ft Kings: Nabuchodonosor (4 Kings 25:28.) or Alexander [the Great], who took Tyre. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 26:8\ft Daughters. Many towns were subject to Tyre: almost all Phoenicia acknowledged her dominion, as well as (Calmet) the seas to which her fleets went, ver. 15. (Selden, Mare 1:6.; Curtius iv.) --- These smaller cities shall fall, and the town shall be of no service except to dry nets. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 26:9\ft Engines. Literally, "vines." (Haydock) --- A covert was thus made for the soldiers, (Veget. 4:15.) when they approached the walls. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 26:10\ft Destroyed. Old Tyre was taken by storm. It is doubtful whether it was pillaged, Ezechiel 29:18. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 26:11\ft Statues. The citizens chained the golden statue of Apollo to the altar of Hercules, for fear of its leaving them, when Alexander [the Great] attacked the town. (Curtius iv.) --- Hiram placed a pillar of gold in the temple of Hercules. (Josephus, contra Apion i.) --- Herodotus (II. 44.) saw another also of emerald stone, (smaragdon) which illuminated the temple in the night. On such the Tyrians might depend; though some render, "the substance or guard of thy strength," denoting the soldiers (Calmet) and towers. (Haydock) --- The gods were treated like the people, and their precious ornaments plundered.\f*
\f + \fr 26:14\ft More, for seventy years, Isaias 23:15. The people returned at the same time as the Jews. (The year of the world 3468.) Soon after, Zacharias (Zacharias 9.) speaks of Tyre as then subsisting. It was very strong in Alexander's time, (who took it with difficulty, as Antigonus did eighteen years later) and had a very extensive commerce when St. Jerome wrote. But all this must be understood of New Tyre. The old city never regained much splendour. (Calmet) --- It is still in ruins. A modern traveller was struck with the completion of this prophecy, beholding a few miserable fishermen drying their nets on the spot!\f*
\f + \fr 26:16\ft Sea: colonies, or tributary to Tyre, ver. 8. (Haydock) --- Leptis, Utica, Carthage,and Cadiz, were founded by Tyrians. (Pliny, [Natural History?] 5:19.) --- Some pretend that these cities were attacked by the conquerors, for manifesting their grief. See Josephus, Antiquities x.; Pineda, etc. --- But we shall not here follow conjectures. --- Astonishment. Hebrew, "troubles," or mourning. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 26:17\ft Dwellest in. Hebrew, "of the seas." Protestants, "seafaring men," (Haydock) being near the sea, or thence deriving thy riches.\f*
\f + \fr 26:18\ft Because. Hebrew, "at thy departure." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "into captivity." (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 26:19\ft Waters; great armies, (ver. 3.) or when thou art in the regions below, Job 26:5. (Calmet) --- Tyre was humbled for her pride, but restored after seventy years, Isaias xxiii. Our Saviour retired into those parts, Matthew 15:21. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 26:20\ft Everlasting: in the grave, till the day of judgment, Psalm 48:12., and Wisdom 12:5. --- Living, assigned to Israel, (chap. 32:24.; Calmet) where holy people adore the true God, and shall rise to life eternal. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 26:21\ft For ever: for a long time, (Theodoret) not at all in thy ancient glory. (Haydock) --- The city subsisted after the days of Nabuchodonosor and of Alexander [the Great], (Calmet) ver. 14. --- But the ancient city was reduced to a mere nothing. (Haydock)\f*

\p
\v 2 Thou, therefore, O son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre:
\p
\v 3 And say to Tyre, that dwelleth at the entry of the sea, being the mart of the people for many islands: Thus saith the Lord God: O Tyre, thou hast said: I am of perfect beauty,
\p
\v 4 And situate in the heart of the sea. Thy neighbours, that built thee, have perfected thy beauty:
\p
\v 5 With fir-trees of Sanir they have built thee, with all sea planks: they have taken cedars from Libanus to make thee masts.
\p
\v 6 They have cut thy oars out of the oaks of Basan: and they have made thee benches of Indian ivory, and cabins, with things brought from the islands of Italy.
\p
\v 7 Fine broidered linen from Egypt was woven for thy sail, to be spread on thy mast: blue and purple from the islands of Elisa, were made thy covering.
\p
\v 8 The inhabitants of Sidon, and the Aradians were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Tyre, were thy pilots.
\p
\v 9 The ancients of Gebal, and the wise men thereof, furnished mariners, for the service of thy various furniture: all the ships of the sea, and their mariners, were thy factors.
\p
\v 10 The Persians, and Lydians, and the Lybians, were thy soldiers, in thy army: they hung up the buckler and the helmet in thee for thy ornament.
\p
\v 11 The men of Arad were with thy army upon thy walls round about: the Pygmeans also that were in thy towers, hung up their quivers on thy walls round about: they perfected thy beauty.
\p
\v 12 The Carthaginians, thy merchants, supplied thy fairs with a multitude of all kinds of riches, with silver, iron, tin, and lead.
\p
\v 13 Greece, Thubal, and Mosoch, they were thy merchants: they brought to thy people slaves and vessels of brass.
\p
\v 14 From the house of Thogorma they brought horses, and horsemen, and mules, to thy market.
\p
\v 15 The men of Dedan were thy merchants: many islands were the traffic of thy hand, they exchanged for thy price teeth of ivory, and ebony.
\p
\v 16 The Syrian was thy merchant, by reason of the multitude of thy works, they set forth precious stones, and purple, and broidered works, and fine linen, and silk, and chodchod, in thy market.
\p
\v 17 Juda, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants with the best corn: they set forth balm, and honey, and oil, and rosin, in thy fairs.
\p
\v 18 The men of Damascus were thy merchants in the multitude of thy works, in the multitude of divers riches, in rich wine, in wool of the best colour.
\p
\v 19 Dan, and Greece, and Mosel, have set forth in thy marts wrought iron: stacte, and calamus were in thy market.
\p
\v 20 The men of Dedan were thy merchants in tapestry for seats.
\p
\v 21 Arabia, and all the princes of Cedar, they were the merchants of thy hand: thy merchants came to thee with lambs, and rams, and kids.
\p
\v 22 The sellers of Saba, and Reema, they were thy merchants: with all the best spices, and precious stones, and gold, which they set forth in thy market.
\p
\v 23 Haran, and Chene, and Eden, were thy merchants: Saba, Assur, and Chelmad, sold to thee.
\p
\v 24 They were thy merchants in divers manners, with bales of blue cloth, and of embroidered work, and of precious riches, which were wrapped up, and bound with cords: they had cedars also in thy merchandise.
\p
\v 25 The ships of the sea, were thy chief in thy merchandise: and thou wast replenished, and glorified exceedingly in the heart of the sea.
\p
\v 26 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the south wind hath broken thee in the heart of the sea.
\p
\v 27 Thy riches, and thy treasures, and thy manifold furniture, thy mariners, and thy pilots, who kept thy goods, and were chief over thy people: thy men of war also, that were in thee, with all thy multitude that is in the midst of thee: shall fall in the heart of the sea, in the day of thy ruin.
\p
\v 28 Thy fleets shall be troubled at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
\p
\v 29 And all that handled the oar, shall come down from their ships: the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall stand upon the land.
\p
\v 30 And they shall mourn over thee with a loud voice, and shall cry bitterly: and they shall cast up dust upon their heads, and shall be sprinkled with ashes.
\p
\v 31 And they shall shave themselves bald for thee, and shall be girded with hair-cloth: and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of soul, with most bitter weeping.
\p
\v 32 And they shall take up a mournful song for thee, and shall lament thee: What city is like Tyre, which is become silent in the midst of the sea?
\p
\v 33 Which by thy merchandise, that went from thee by sea, didst fill many people: which by the multitude of thy riches, and of thy people, didst enrich the kings of the earth.
\p
\v 34 Now thou art destroyed by the sea, thy riches are in the bottom of the waters, and all the multitude that was in the midst of thee is fallen.
\p
\v 35 All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at thee: and all their kings, being struck with the storm, have changed their countenance.

The idea is childish. The king who was taken and slain at this siege, was probably (Calmet) Ithobalos. (Josephus, Antiquities 10:11.) --- Origen applies this to the angel guardian of Tyre. St. Augustine thins an allusion is made to the fall of Lucifer. But it may all refer to the king, (Calmet) though others explain part of him and the rest of the devil. (St. Jerome) (Estius)\f*

\f + \fr 28:12\ft Resemblance. The king of Tyre, by his dignity and his natural perfections, bore in himself a certain resemblance to God, by reason of which he might be called the seal of resemblance, etc. But what is here said to him is commonly understood of Lucifer, the king over all the children of pride. (Challoner) --- A seal is perfect when it represents things exactly. The prophet speaks ironically, to repress the king's vanity.\f*
\f + \fr 28:13\ft Paradise. Thou hadst every thing delightful at Tyre. (Calmet) --- Covering. Hebrew, "bandage;" diadem, (Haydock) or belt. Septuagint specify twelve stones. See Exodus 28:17. --- Pipes; music used at the coronation, which was celebrated as a birth-day. (Calmet) --- God gives and withdraws power from all kings. As long as they act well, they are in a sort of sanctuary. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 28:14\ft Stretched out. That is, thy wings extended. This alludes to the figure of the cherubims in the sanctuary, which with stretched out wings covered the ark, (Challoner) on the holy mountain. (St. Jerome, etc.) --- Fire. That is, bright and precious stones, which sparkle like fire. (Challoner) --- With these the king's robes glittered, or he walked upon them, Esther 1:6. (Calmet) --- Calcacabatur onyx. (Lucan x.)\f*

\p
\v 1 In *the tenth year, the tenth month, the eleventh day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against Pharao, king of Egypt: and thou shalt prophesy of him, and of all Egypt:
\p
\v 3 Speak, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, Pharao, king of Egypt, thou great dragon that liest in the midst of thy rivers, and sayest: The river is mine, and I made myself.
\p
\v 4 But I will put a bridle in thy jaws: and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick to thy scales: and I will draw thee out of the midst of thy rivers, and all thy fish shall stick to thy scales.
\p
\v 5 And I will cast thee forth into the desert, and all the fish of thy river: thou shalt fall upon the face of the earth; thou shalt not be taken up nor gathered together: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the earth, and to the fowls of the air.
\p
\v 6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord: *because thou hast been a staff of a reed to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 7 When they took hold of thee with the hand, thou didst break and rent all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brokest and weakenedst all their loins.
\p
\v 8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will bring the sword upon thee: and cut off man and beast out of thee.
\p
\v 9 And the land of Egypt shall become a desert and a wilderness: and they shall know that I am the Lord: because thou hast said: The river is mine, and I made it.
\p
\v 10 Therefore, behold I come against thee and thy rivers: and I will make the land of Egypt utterly desolate, and wasted by the sword, from the tower of Syene even to the borders of Ethiopia.
\p
\v 11 The foot of man shall not pass through it, neither shall the foot of beasts go through it; nor shall it be inhabited during forty years.
\p
\v 12 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate, and the cities thereof in the midst of the cities that are destroyed, and they shall be desolate for forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
\p
\v 13 For thus saith the Lord God: At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians from the people among whom they had been scattered.
\p
\v 14 And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will place them in the land of Phatures, in the land of their nativity, and they shall be there a low kingdom:
\p
\v 15 It shall be the lowest among other kingdoms, and it shall no more be exalted over the nations; and I will diminish them, that they shall rule no more over the nations.
\p
\v 16 And they shall be no more a confidence to the house of Israel, teaching iniquity, that they may flee, and follow them: and they shall know that I am the Lord God.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, *in the first month, in the first of the month: that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 18 Son of man, Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, hath made his army to undergo hard service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: and there hath been no reward given him, nor his army for Tyre, for the service that he rendered me against it.
\p
\v 19 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will set Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, in the land of Egypt: *and he shall take her multitude, and take the booty thereof for a prey, and rifle the spoils thereof: and it shall be wages for his army,
\p
\v 20 And for the service that he hath done me against it: I have given him the land of Egypt, because he hath laboured for me, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 21 In that day a horn shall bud forth to the house of Israel, and I will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them: and they shall know that I am the Lord.

(Herodotus 2:70.) --- Apries sent an army against Cyrene, which being defeated as it was thought by the king's fault, many of the Egyptians revolted. He sent Amasis to reduce them, but they gave him the crown. (Herodotus 2:161.; 4:159.) --- Nabuchodonsor taking advantage of these disturbances, and perhaps invited by Amasis, entered Egypt, drove Apries into Higher Egypt, slew many of the inhabitants, and Jews, etc., and left Amasis to govern the wretched remains of that kingdom. (Usher, the year of the world 3430.) The Scripture, however, seems to say that Pharao was slain; (Jeremias 43.; etc.) (Calmet) which Ctesias assures us was done by Amasis, though Herodotus (II. 169.) says he was killed by the people, and buried with his fathers. This latter circumstance is not very probable: but the historian followed the account of the priests, who would mention what was most honourable for the nation.

(Ctesias) --- Egypt has almost ever since been subject to foreign princes, (Haydock) Persians, Greeks, Romans, Saracens, Mamelukes, and Turks.

\cd The Assyrian empire fell for their pride: the Egyptian shall fall in like manner.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass in the eleventh year, the third month, the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, speak to Pharao, king of Egypt, and to his people: To whom art thou like, in thy greatness?
\p
\v 3 Behold, the Assyrian was like a cedar in Libanus, with fair branches, and full of leaves, of a high stature, and his top was elevated among the thick boughs.
\p
\v 4 The waters nourished him, the deep set him up on high, the streams thereof ran round about his roots, and it sent forth its rivulets to all the trees of the country.
\p
\v 5 Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the country: and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters.
\p
\v 6 And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the forest brought forth their young under his branches, and the assembly of many nations dwelt under his shadow.
\p
\v 7 And he was most beautiful for his greatness, and for the spreading of his branches: for his root was near great waters.
\p
\v 8 The cedars in the paradise of God were not higher than he, the fir-trees did not equal his top, neither were the plane-trees to be compared with him for branches: no tree in the paradise of God, was like him in his beauty.
\p
\v 9 For I made him beautiful, and thick set with many branches: and all the trees of pleasure, that were in the paradise of God, envied him.
\p
\v 10 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Because he was exalted in height, and shot up his top green and thick, and his heart was lifted up in his height:
\p
\v 11 I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the nations, he shall deal with him: I have cast him out according to his wickedness.
\p
\v 12 And strangers and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him down, and cast him away upon the mountains, and his boughs shall fall in every valley, and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the country: and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow, and leave him.
\p
\v 13 All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins, and all the beasts of the field were among his branches.
\p
\v 14 For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height: nor shoot up their tops among the thick branches and leaves, neither shall any of them that are watered stand up in their height: for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down into the pit.
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord God: In the day when he went down to hell, I brought in mourning, I covered him with the deep: and withheld its rivers, and restrained the many waters: Libanus grieved for him, and all the trees of the field trembled.
\p
\v 16 I shook the nations with the sound of his fall, when I brought him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of pleasure, the choice and best in Libanus, all that were moistened with waters, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.
\p
\v 17 For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are slain by the sword: and the arm of every one shall sit down under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
\p
\v 18 To whom art thou like, O thou that art famous and lofty among the trees of pleasure? Behold, thou art brought down with the trees of pleasure, to the lowest parts of the earth: thou shalt sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword: this is Pharao, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.

\v 6 And I will water the earth with thy stinking blood upon the mountains, and the valleys shall be filled with thee.
\p
\v 7 *And I will cover the heavens, when thou shalt be put out, and I will make the stars thereof dark: I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.
\p
\v 8 I will make all the lights of heaven to mourn over thee, and I will cause darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord God, when thy wounded shall fall in the midst of the land, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 9 And I shall provoke to anger the heart of many people, when I shall have brought in thy destruction among the nations upon the lands which thou knowest not.
\p
\v 10 And I will make many people to be amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horridly afraid for thee, when my sword shall begin to fly upon their faces: and they shall be astonished on a sudden, every one for his own life, in the day of thy ruin.
\p
\v 11 For thus saith the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
\p
\v 12 By the swords of the mighty I will overthrow thy multitude: all these nations are invincible: and they shall waste the pride of Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.
\p
\v 13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof, that were beside the great waters: and the foot of man shall trouble them no more, neither shall the hoof of beasts trouble them.
\p
\v 14 Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord God:
\p
\v 15 When I shall have made the land of Egypt desolate: and the land shall be destitute of her fulness, when I shall have struck all the inhabitants thereof: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 16 This is the lamentation, and they shall lament therewith: the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith: for Egypt, and for the multitude thereof they shall lament therewith, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, *in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 18 Son of man, sing a mournful song for the multitude of Egypt: and cast her down, both her, and the daughters of the mighty nations to the lowest part of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.
\p
\v 19 Whom dost thou excel in beauty? go down and sleep with the uncircumcised.
\p
\v 20 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain with the sword: the sword is given, they have drawn her down, and all her people.
\p
\v 21 The most mighty among the strong ones shall speak to him from the midst of hell, they that went down with his helpers, and slept uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
\p
\v 22 Assur is there, and all his multitude: their graves are round about him, all of them slain, and that fell by the sword.
\p
\v 23 Whose graves are set in the lowest parts of the pit: and his multitude lay round about his grave: all of them slain, and fallen by the sword, they that heretofore spread terror in the land of the living.
\p
\v 24 There is Elam, and all his multitude, round about his grave, all of them slain, and fallen by the sword: that went down uncircumcised to the lowest parts of the earth: that caused their terror in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit.
\p
\v 25 In the midst of the slain they have set him a bed among all his people: their graves are round about him: all these are uncircumcised, and slain by the sword: for they spread their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that descend into the pit: they are laid in the midst of the slain.
\p
\v 26 There is Mosoch, and Thubal, and all their multitude: their graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, and slain, and falling by the sword, though they spread their terror in the land of the living.
\p
\v 27 And they shall not sleep with the brave, and with them that fell uncircumcised, that went down to hell with their weapons, and laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities were in their bones: because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
\p
\v 28 So thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt sleep with them that are slain by the sword.
\p
\v 29 There is Edom and her kings, and all her princes, who with their army are joined with them that are slain by the sword: and have slept with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down into the pit.
\p
\v 30 There are all the princes of the north, and all the hunters: who were brought down with the slain, fearing and confounded in their strength: who slept uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit.
\p
\v 31 Pharao saw them, and he was comforted concerning all his multitude, which was slain by the sword: Pharao, and all his army, saith the Lord God:
\p
\v 32 Because I have spread my terror in the land of the living, and he hath slept in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword: Pharao, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.

\cd The duty of the watchman appointed by God: the justice of God's ways: his judgments upon the Jews.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them: When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man, one of their meanest, and make him a watchman over them:
\p
\v 3 And he see the sword coming upon the land, and sound the trumpet, and tell the people:
\p
\v 4 Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, whosoever he be, and doth not look to himself, if the sword come and cut him off, his blood shall be upon his own head.
\p
\v 5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not look to himself; his blood shall be upon him: but if he look to himself, he shall save his life.
\p
\v 6 And if the watchman see the sword coming, and sound not the trumpet, and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come and cut off a soul from among them; he indeed is taken away in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman.
\p
\v 7 *So thou, O son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore, thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.
\p
\v 8 When I say to the wicked: O wicked man, thou shalt surely die: if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked man from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.
\p
\v 9 But if thou tell the wicked man, that he may be converted from his ways, and he be not converted from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
\p
\v 10 Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you have spoken, saying: Our iniquities and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?
\p
\v 11 *Say to them: As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: and why will you die, O house of Israel?
\p
\v 12 Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the children of thy people: The justice of the just shall not deliver him, in what day soever he shall sin; and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him, in what day soever he shall turn from his wickedness; and the just shall not be able to live in his justice, in what day soever he shall sin.
\p
\v 13 Yea, if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live, and he, trusting in his justice, commit iniquity, all his justices shall be forgotten: and in his iniquity, which he hath committed, in the same shall he die.
\p
\v 14 And if I shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die: and he do penance for his sin and do judgment and justice;
\p
\v 15 And if that wicked man restore the pledge, and render what he had robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no unjust thing, he shall surely live, and shall not die.
\p
\v 16 None of his sins, which he hath committed, shall be imputed to him; he hath done judgment and justice, he shall surely live.
\p
\v 17 And the children of thy people have said: The way of the Lord is not equitable: whereas, their own way is unjust.
\p
\v 18 For when the just shall depart from his justice, and commit iniquities, he shall die in them.
\p
\v 19 And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness, and shall do judgments and justice, he shall live in them.
\p
\v 20 And you say: *The way of the Lord is not right: I will judge every one of you according to his ways, O house of Israel.
\p
\v 21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year* of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that there came to me one that was fled from Jerusalem, saying: The city is laid waste.
\p
\v 22 And the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before he that was fled came; and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning, and my mouth being opened, I was silent no more.
\p
\v 23 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 24 Son of man, they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land of Israel, speak, saying: Abraham was one, and he inherited the land; but we are many, the land is given us in possession.
\p
\v 25 Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: You that eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses, and that shed blood: shall you possess the land by inheritance?
\p
\v 26 You stood on your swords, you have committed abominations, and every one hath defiled his neighbour's wife: and shall you possess the land by inheritance?
\p
\v 27 Say thou thus to them: Thus saith the Lord God: As I live, they that dwell in the ruinous places shall fall by the sword: and he that is in the field, shall be given to the beasts to be devoured: and they that are in holds and caves, shall die of the pestilence.
\p
\v 28 And I will make the land a wilderness and a desert, and the proud strength thereof shall fail; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, because there is none to pass by them.
\p
\v 29 And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have made their land waste and desolate, for all their abominations which they have committed.
\p
\v 30 And thou, son of man: the children of thy people, that talk of thee by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, each men to his neighbour, saying: Come, and let us hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord.
\p
\v 31 And they come to thee, as if a people were coming in, and my people sit before thee: and hear thy words, and do them not: for they turn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart goeth after their covetousness.
\p
\v 32 And thou art to them as a musical song, which is sung with a sweet and agreeable voice: and they hear thy words, and do them not.
\p
\v 33 And when that which was foretold shall come to pass, (for behold it is coming) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.

Literally, "last," (Haydock) which seems to denote such as are chosen without regard to their dignity or obscurity in life, Genesis 47:2., and 3 Kings 12:31. (Calmet) --- Pastors are not excused from admonishing the people for fear of danger or despair of reclaiming them, as each one is bound to do his duty. (St. Jerome) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 33:6\ft Iniquity, not regarding the admonitions of his pastor; (chap. 3:18.; Calmet) or rather of conscience, when the guide proves faithless and silent, as in this instance. (Haydock) --- The people were persuaded that none suffered except for some fault, ver. 10.; Jeremias 31:30., Daniel 13:52., and Genesis 44:16. The author of the Book of Job takes great pains to remove this mistake. God sometimes sends crosses for a trial, (Calmet) and to increase the merit of his servants; though it be very true, (Haydock) "no one is miserable except he deserve it." (St. Augustine)\f*
\f + \fr 33:8\ft Surely die a temporal, (Theodoret) or rather an eternal death. (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 33:10\ft Live? They suppose their case to be desperate, as their fathers had sinned, Ezechiel 18. The prophet shews that none are punished except for their own faults, (Calmet) and that "each one has free-will to be saved or to be lost." (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 33:11\ft Desire. The sinner's damnation is not an object of God's pleasure, Ezechiel 18:23. (Calmet) --- He has an antecedent will to save all. He knocks at the door of our heart, (Apocalypse 3:20.) and if man do what depends on him, nothing will be wanting on the part of God. (St. Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologiae] 1:2. q. 109. and 112.) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 33:12\ft Hurt him. God effaces all past crimes: yet a relapse makes them as it were revive, and is pardoned with more difficulty, Matthew 18:35. Some read, "In what day the converted sinner groans, he shall be saved," as if they had taken in part of Isaias 30:15.\f*
\f + \fr 33:17\ft Equitable; as we are much more inclined to vice than to virtue. This argumentation is inconclusive, as God owes nothing to man; and what good the latter does, is an effect of his grace. The propensity to evil is no excuse, as man is still free. He is judged according to the dispositions in which he is found at the hour of death; yet we must not infer, that those who have spent their lives in sinning will be no worse treated than the person who dies guilty of a single crime.\f*
\f + \fr 33:21\ft Twelfth. Roman Septuagint, "tenth." Syriac, "eleventh year,...in the twelfth month;" which Theodoret thinks more probable, as the city was taken in the ninth of the fourth month of that year. Yet even so, it is strange that the news should not arrive before. Some think (Calmet) that the messenger came also to announce what happened after the death of Godolias. (Sanctius) --- Captivity. Here it is evident that the prophet dates from that event, Ezechiel 1., etc. (Haydock) --- As he prophesied on the very day when the city was besieged, (chap. 24:2.) so (chap. 24:26.) he foretold that one should come three years after to inform him of the capture. (Worthington) --- Then the people would believe him, (ibid. Ezechiel 24:27.) Calmet) and he would open his mouth boldly, ver. 22. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 33:24\ft Places. He has answered those who despaired, ver. 10. Now he turns to the presumptuous, who expected to be treated like Abraham, though they did not imitate his virtues. (Calmet) --- They perhaps entertained these sentiments before the death of Godolias, thinking to establish themselves in the land. Afterwards the prophet Jeremias could not prevail on them to remain, though God promised them security.\f*
\f + \fr 33:25\ft To them. Grabe marks to ver. 27., Thus saith, etc., as wanting in the Septuagint, though not in the Alexandrian copy. St. Jerome reckons eight verses or lines omitted. (Haydock) --- The Complutensian and Theodoret read them with some variations. --- The blood. It must be carefully extracted, Genesis 9:4., and Leviticus 7:26. --- Uncleannesses; idols, in which you trust.\f*
\f + \fr 33:26\ft Swords, thinking to live thereby, (Genesis 27:40.) and to be secure. But I will disarm you. The pestilence shall find out those in the rocks, ver. 27.\f*
\f + \fr 33:30\ft Walls, the resort of idle people. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 33:31\ft In to a religious meeting. (Chaldean) Perhaps they came on the sabbath to his house. Yet they made a just and song of his instructions. (Calmet) --- They heard them with pleasure, but did not reform their lives. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 33:33\ft Coming. The desolation of Jerusalem, (Haydock) and what I have foretold, hath already taken place; or, the news will presently arrive: as it did the following morning, ver. 21. (Calmet)\f*

\cd Evil pastors are reproved: Christ, the true pastor, shall come and gather together his flock from all parts of the earth, and preserve it for ever.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to the shepherds: Thus saith the Lord God: *Wo to the shepherds of Israel, that fed themselves: should not the flocks be fed by the shepherds?
\p
\v 3 You eat the milk, and you clothed yourselves with the wool, and you killed that which was fat: but my flock you did not feed.
\p
\v 4 The weak you have not strengthened, and that which was sick you have not healed; that which was broken you have not bound up, and that which was driven away you have not brought again, neither have you sought that which was lost: but you ruled over them with rigour, and with a high hand.
\p
\v 5 And my sheep were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became the prey of all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.
\p
\v 6 My sheep have wandered in every mountain, and in every high hill; and my flocks were scattered upon the face of the earth, and there was none that sought them; there was none, I say, that sought them.
\p
\v 7 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
\p
\v 8 As I live, saith the Lord God, forasmuch as my flocks have been made a spoil, and my sheep are become a prey to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd; for my shepherds did not seek after my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flocks:
\p
\v 9 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:
\p
\v 10 Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I myself come upon the shepherds, I will require my flock at their hand, and I will cause them to cease from feeding the flock any more; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more: and I will deliver my flock from their mouth, and it shall no more be meat for them.
\p
\v 11 For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I myself will seek my sheep, and will visit them.
\p
\v 12 As the shepherd visiteth his flock, in the day when he shall be in the midst of his sheep that were scattered; so will I visit my sheep, and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered, in the cloudy and dark day.
\p
\v 13 And I will bring them out from the peoples, and will gather them out of the countries, and will bring them to their own land; and I will feed them in the mountains of Israel, by the rivers, and in all the habitations of the land:
\p
\v 14 I will feed them in the most fruitful pastures, and their pastures shall be in the high mountains of Israel; there shall they rest on the green grass, and be fed in fat pastures upon the mountains of Israel.
\p
\v 15 I will feed my sheep: and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 16 I will seek that which was lost; and that which was driven away, I will bring again; and I will bind up that which was broken, and I will strengthen that which was weak, and that which was fat and strong I will preserve: and I will feed them in judgment.
\p
\v 17 And as for you, O my flocks, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, of rams and of he-goats.
\p
\v 18 Was it not enough for you to feed upon good pastures? but you must also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures: and when you drank the clearest water, you troubled the rest with your feet.
\p
\v 19 And my sheep were fed with that which you had trodden with your feet; and they drank what your feet had troubled.
\p
\v 20 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God to you: Behold, I myself will judge between the fat cattle and the lean.
\p
\v 21 Because you thrusted with sides and shoulders, and struck all the weak cattle with your horns, till they were scattered abroad.
\p
\v 22 I will save my flock, and it shall be no more a spoil; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.
\p
\v 23 *And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
\p
\v 24 And I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David the prince, in the midst of them: I, the Lord, have spoken it.
\p
\v 25 And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they that dwell in the wilderness, shall sleep secure in the forests.
\p
\v 26 And I will make them a blessing round about my hill: and I will send down the rain in its season, there shall be showers of blessing.
\p
\v 27 And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be in their land without fear: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have broken the bonds of their yoke, and shall have delivered them out of the hand of those that rule over them.
\p
\v 28 And they shall be no more for a spoil to the nations; neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them, but they shall dwell securely without any terror.
\p
\v 29 And I will raise up for them a bud of renown: and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither shall they bear any more the reproach of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 30 And they shall know that I, the Lord, their God, am with them, and that they are my people, the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 31 *And you my flocks, the flocks of my pasture, are men; and I am the Lord your God, saith the Lord God.

(Calmet) --- That king had been dead long before, so that no Jew or heretic can deny but that the Messias is here meant, as [in] Ezechiel 37:24., etc. (Worthington) --- He possessed eminently all the virtues of David, and was of his seed. Zorobabel, etc., cannot be understood, as we have no proof that the governors after the captivity were chosen from the tribe of Juda, Ezechiel 21:27.\f*

\f + \fr 34:26\ft Make. Literally, "place." (Haydock) --- Septuagint read not a blessing, which seems superfluous. (Calmet) --- Yet Chaldean has it, and the idea is more complete. (Haydock)\f*

\f + \fr 34:31\ft Men. What has been said of sheep (Menochius) relates to you. --- Am the Lord. This is not in Hebrew or Protestants. (Haydock) --- But it is found in one Hebrew manuscript and Septuagint, as this version is thus frequently confirmed. (Kennicott, Dis. ii.)\f*

\cd The judgment of Mount Seir, for their hatred of Israel.
\p
\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 2 Son of man, set thy face against Mount Seir, and prophesy concerning it, and say to it:
\p
\v 3 Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, Mount Seir, and I will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and I will make thee desolate and waste.
\p
\v 4 I will destroy thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 5 Because thou hast been an everlasting enemy, and hast shut up the children of Israel, in the hands of the sword in the time of their affliction, in the time of their last iniquity.
\p
\v 6 Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will deliver thee up to blood, and blood shall pursue thee: and whereas thou hast hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.
\p
\v 7 And I will make Mount Seir waste and desolate; and I will take away from it him that goeth and him that returneth.
\p
\v 8 And I will fill his mountains with his men that are slain: in thy hills, and in thy vallies, and in thy torrents they shall fall that are slain with the sword.
\p
\v 9 I will make thee everlasting desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord God.
\p
\v 10 Because thou hast said: The two nations, and the two lands shall be mine, and I will possess them by inheritance: whereas the Lord was there.
\p
\v 11 Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will do according to thy wrath, and according to thy envy which thou hast exercised in hatred to them: and I will be made known by them, when I shall have judged thee.
\p
\v 12 And thou shalt know that I, the Lord, have heard all thy reproaches, that thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying: They are desolate, they are given to us to consume.
\p
\v 13 And you rose up against me with your mouth, and have derogated from me by your words: I have heard them.
\p
\v 14 Thus saith the Lord God: When the whole earth shall rejoice, I will make thee a wilderness.
\p
\v 15 As thou hast rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was laid waste, so will I do to thee: thou shalt be laid waste, O Mount Seir, and all Idumea: and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\f + \fr 35:2\ft Face. Address, or speak without fearing any man. (Worthington) --- Seir: Idumea. He speaks of its devastation, both by Nabuchodonosor on the side of Moab, and by the Machabees in what remained, Jeremias 27:7., and 1 Machabees 4:60., and 14:33. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 35:5\ft Enemy. God revenges the injuries done to his Church, as if they were done to himself, Acts 9:4. (Worthington) --- The enmity of Jacob and of Esau seemed to commence in the womb, and was increased by the purchase of the birth-right, till Jacob's prudence disarmed his brother. Their descendants sought every opportunity to injure one another. The Idumeans shewed their ill-will particularly, when the Jews were most distressed. This was a piece of the greatest cruelty.\f*
\f + \fr 35:6\ft Blood. The Machabees sprung from the same stock. Pursue the Idumeans, and force them to receive circumcision, 1 Machabees 4:15.\f*
\f + \fr 35:9\ft Inhabited for a considerable time, as [in] Ezechiel 26:20.\f*
\f + \fr 35:10\ft Two. I will add the country of the Jews to my own, or will possess the land belonging to the kingdoms of Juda and of Israel. Their hopes were blasted. They never occupied any thing belonging to the Israelites, and what they had taken from Juda, as far as Hebron, was recovered. --- There, witness of these designs, and guardian of his temple, etc.\f*
\f + \fr 35:11\ft Wrath. The Jews shall treat you as you have threatened to do unto them. --- By them, my people. Septuagint, "to thee."\f*
\f + \fr 35:13\ft Derogated. Septuagint, "bawled;" or Hebrew, "multiplied your words against me," as if I could not protect my inheritance. (Haydock) --- You would pretend to judge me, and to fathom my designs.\f*
\f + \fr 35:14\ft Rejoice. After the captivity, the Machabees shall conquer Edom.\f*
\f + \fr 35:15\ft As, etc., is not in the Roman Septuagint. St. Jerome says it was marked with an asterisk, being taken from Theodotion. (Calmet) --- Grabe supplies to thou shalt. His copy has the rest:..."thou shalt know that I am their Lord." (Haydock)\f*

\cd The restoration of Israel, not for their merits, but by God's special grace. Christ's baptism.
\p
\v 1 And thou, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: *Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord:
\p
\v 2 Thus saith the Lord God: Because the enemy hath said of you: Aha, the everlasting heights are given to us for an inheritance.
\p
\v 3 Therefore prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Because you have been desolate, and trodden under foot on every side, and made an inheritance to the rest of the nations, and are become the subject of the talk, and the reproach of the people:
\p
\v 4 Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the brooks, and to the vallies, and to desolate places, and ruinous walls, and to the cities that are forsaken, that are spoiled, and derided by the rest of the nations round about.
\p
\v 5 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: In the fire of my zeal I have spoken of the rest of the nations, and of all Edom, who have taken my land to themselves, for an inheritance with joy, and with all the heart, and with the mind: and have cast it out to lay it waste.
\p
\v 6 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the ridges, and to the vallies: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I have spoken in my zeal, and in my indignation, because you have borne the shame of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: I have lifted up my hand, that the Gentiles who are round about you, shall themselves bear their shame.
\p
\v 8 But as for you, O mountains of Israel, shoot ye forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel: for they are at hand to come.
\p
\v 9 For lo I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be ploughed and sown.
\p
\v 10 And I will multiply men upon you, and all the house of Israel: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the ruinous places shall be repaired.
\p
\v 11 And I will make you abound with men and with beasts: and they shall be multiplied, and increase: and I will settle you as from the beginning, and will give you greater gifts than you had from the beginning: and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 12 And I will bring men upon you, my people Israel, and they shall possess thee for their inheritance: and thou shalt be their inheritance, and shalt no more henceforth be without them.
\p
\v 13 Thus saith the Lord God: Because they say of you: Thou art a devourer of men, and one that suffocatest thy nation:
\p
\v 14 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, nor destroy thy nation any more, saith the Lord God:
\p
\v 15 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the nations any more, nor shalt thou bear the reproach of the people, nor lose thy nation any more, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 16 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 17 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it with their ways, and with their doings: their way was before me like the uncleanness of a menstruous woman.
\p
\v 18 And I poured out my indignation upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land, and with their idols they defiled it.
\p
\v 19 And I scattered them among the nations, and they are dispersed through the countries: I have judged them according to their ways, and their devices.
\p
\v 20 And when they entered among the nations whither they went, *they profaned my holy name, when it was said of them: This is the people of the Lord, and they are come forth out of his land.
\p
\v 21 And I have regarded my own holy name, which the house of Israel hath profaned among the nations to which they went in.
\p
\v 22 Therefore thou shalt say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: It is not for your sake that I will do this, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the nations whither you went.
\p
\v 23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the Gentiles, which you have profaned in the midst of them: that the Gentiles may know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord of hosts, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
\p
\v 24 For I will take you from among the Gentiles, and will gather you together out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
\p
\v 25 And I will pour upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and I will cleanse you from all your idols.
\p
\v 26 *And I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh.
\p
\v 27 And I will put my spirit in the midst of you: and I will cause you to walk in my commandments, and to keep my judgments, and do them.
\p
\v 28 And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\p
\v 29 And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for corn, and will multiply it, and will lay no famine upon you.
\p
\v 30 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you bear no more the reproach of famine among the nations.
\p
\v 31 And you shall remember your wicked ways, and your doings that were not good: and your iniquities, and your wicked deeds shall displease you.
\p
\v 32 It is not for your sakes that I will do this, saith the Lord God, be it known to you: be confounded, and ashamed at your own ways, O house of Israel.
\p
\v 33 Thus saith the Lord God: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, and shall cause the cities to be inhabited, and shall repair the ruinous places.
\p
\v 34 And the desolate land shall be tilled, which before was waste in the sight of all that passed by.
\p
\v 35 They shall say: This land that was untilled is become as a garden of pleasure: and the cities that were abandoned, and desolate, and destroyed, are peopled and fenced.
\p
\v 36 And the nations, that shall be left round about you, shall know that I, the Lord, have built up what was destroyed, and planted what was desolate, that I, the Lord, have spoken and done it.
\p
\v 37 Thus saith the Lord God: Moreover in this shall the house of Israel find me, that I will do it for them: I will multiply them as a flock of men.
\p
\v 38 As a holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts: so shall the waste cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord.

\f + \fr 36:1\ft Israel. The restoration of the Jews and the redemption of Christ, constitute this fourth division. (Worthington) -- Edom has seized parts of the country, as if I had abandoned my people for ever.\f*
\f + \fr 36:2\ft Heights. Septuagint, "deserts." The mountains are often styled eternal, as being the best symbols of durability, Deuteronomy 33:15.\f*
\f + \fr 36:3\ft Reproach. This God had repeatedly threatened, Deuteronomy 28:37., (Calmet) and Jeremias 24:9. --- People talked of their distress. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 36:8\ft Israel. Some apply what follows to the captives returning; others, perceiving that the expressions were not then literally verified, have recourse to the reign of 1000 years. Others again explain the whole of Christ's Church. But some expressions refer to it, and others to the captives; which, though mixed together, induce no confusion, as what belongs to the Jews was a figure of what regarded Christ; and the predictions of the Messias might be applied to the Jews in an hyperbolical sense. (St. Augustine, Doct. 3:34.) (St. Jerome) (Menochius) (Tirinus) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 36:11\ft Greater. Septuagint, "similar." (Haydock) --- It would be difficult to shew that the Jews arrived at greater eminence after the captivity than before, (Calmet) though they were less addicted to idolatry. Their kingdom was not independent: they had no prophets, etc. But the superior numbers and excellence of the Christian Church is manifest.\f*
\f + \fr 36:12\ft Them. Antiochus and the Romans laid waste the country; (Calmet) and Adrian would not allow the Jews to come near Jerusalem. (St. Jerome) (Eusebius, [History of the Church] 4:6.) --- The people were not indeed removed together, as they had been. But all this is verified only in the Church, which in the midst of persecutions always subsists. Theodoret thinks these promises were conditional with regard to the Jews.\f*
\f + \fr 36:13\ft Men. This remark was very ancient, Numbers 13:33. Wars had almost always raged in the country. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 36:15\ft More. This whole promise principally relates to the Church of Christ, and God's perpetual protection of her; for as to the carnal Jews, they have been removed out of their land these sixteen hundred years. (Challoner)\f*
\f + \fr 36:18\ft Blood of their own children, and of the innocent, Ezechiel 16:36., and 22:2., and 33:25.\f*
\f + \fr 36:20\ft Land. Yet their conduct was no better than that of infidels. Thus they throw the blame on the law, and upon God himself, Jeremias 48:9., etc. (Calmet) --- The Jews had provoked God to punish them with captivity; and hence the nations took occasion to blaspheme, that he could not protect them. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 36:22\ft Holy, that my attributes of justice and mercy may be confessed, Isaias 48:2., Daniel 3:49., and Judith 8:24.\f*
\f + \fr 36:25\ft Water. R. David and the Chaldean explain this of the remission of sin; and all Christians understand it of baptism in water, remitting all offences, Ephesians 5:26., and Titus 3:5. (Worthington) --- He alludes to the purification of the Jews, which prefigured baptism and penance, in which the blood of Christ is applied to our souls. This of course was only fulfilled in his church.\f*
\f + \fr 36:26\ft Flesh. The Jews at their return fell not so often into the sins of idolatry, etc., of which the prophets complained. But yet they were far from answering this character. Great irregularities prevailed under Nehemias, and in the days of the Machabees the priests publicly worshipped idols, 1 Esdras 9., and 2 Esdras 5., and 8., and 2 Machabees 4., and 5. Christ enables his servants to act with purity unto the end, by the influence of his all-powerful grace. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 36:27\ft Do them. Hence the efficacy of grace appears, (St. Augustine; Haydock) and hereby some keep the commandments. (Worthington) --- God assists our free-will. (Theodoret) (Cornelius a Lapide) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 36:37\ft Find. Hebrew, "seek." I will cause great multitudes to come to the solemn feast. This was seen still more after the conversion of the Gentiles. (Calmet)\f*

\cd A vision of the resurrection of dry bones, foreshewing the deliverance of the people from their captivity. Juda and Israel shall be all one kingdom under Christ. God's everlasting covenant with the Church.
\p
\v 1 The hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of the Lord; and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones.
\p
\v 2 And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were exceeding dry.
\p
\v 3 And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest.
\p
\v 4 And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones: and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live.
\p
\v 6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin; and I will give you spirit, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 7 And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint.
\p
\v 8 And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them.
\p
\v 9 And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again.
\p
\v 10 And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
\p
\v 11 And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel: they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.
\p
\v 12 Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel.
\p
\v 13 And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people:
\p
\v 14 And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God:
\p
\v 15 And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
\p
\v 16 And thou, son of man, take thee a stick, and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the children of Israel, his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates.
\p
\v 17 And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand.
\p
\v 18 And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this?
\p
\v 19 Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that are associated with him: and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand.
\p
\v 20 And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes.
\p
\v 21 And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone; and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land.
\p
\v 22 *And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all; and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms.
\p
\v 23 Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities; and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
\p
\v 24 *And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd; they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them.
\p
\v 25 And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children's children, for ever; and David, my servant, shall be their prince for ever.
\p
\v 26 *And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish them, and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.
\p
\v 27 And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

(Worthington) --- If this were not to take place, it would not be adduced as a figure. (Tertullian) (St. Jerome)\f*
\f + \fr 37:5\ft Spirit. That is, life, soul, and breath. (Challoner) --- At the resurrection, the same souls shall return to their respective bodies.\f*

(Calmet) (Romans 11:17.) --- Before the latter event took place God united the two kingdoms, to teach us that when we labour for the conversion of heretics, as in England, Catholics must first agree among themselves, that so all may more easily become one fold under one shepherd. (Worthington)\f*

\v 15 And thou shalt come out of thy place from the northern parts, thou and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army.
\p
\v 16 And thou shalt come upon my people of Israel like a cloud, to cover the earth. Thou shalt be in the latter days, and I will bring thee upon my land; that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
\p
\v 17 Thus saith the Lord God: Thou then art he, of whom I have spoken in the days of old, by my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in the days of those times, that I would bring thee upon them.
\p
\v 18 And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day of the coming of Gog upon the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my indignation shall come up in my wrath.
\p
\v 19 And I have spoken in my zeal, and in the fire of my anger, that in that day there shall be a great commotion upon the land of Israel:
\p
\v 20 *So that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, shall be moved at my presence: and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the hedges shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
\p
\v 21 And I will call in the sword against him in all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man's sword shall be pointed against his brother.
\p
\v 22 And I will judge him with pestilence, and with blood, and with violent rain, and vast hailstones: I will rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon his army, and upon the many nations that are with him.
\p
\v 23 And I will be magnified, and I will be sanctified: and I will be known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

\f + \fr 38:2\ft Gog. This name, which signifies hidden, or covered, is taken in this place either for the persecutors of the Church of God in general, or some arch persecutor in particular; such as Antichrist shall be in the latter days. See Apocalypse 20:8. And what is said of the punishment of Gog, is verified by the unhappy end of persecutors. --- Magog. Scythia or Tartary, whence the Turks and other enemies of the Church of Christ originally sprung. (Challoner) --- These are supposed to be the princes of some northern and barbarous country, (Worthington) peopled by the son of Japhet. (St. Jerome) --- St. Augustine (City of God 20:11.) observes, that as the Church is spread everywhere, so also are persecutors. But Christ will overcome them all. (Worthington) --- This prophecy is very difficult. It seems literally to refer to Cambyses, who invaded Judea about seventy years after the temple had been destroyed, and perished by the hand of God, at Ecbatana, upon Mount Carmel. It is very usual with the prophets to give fictitious names; as the king of Tyre is called a cherub, and Jerusalem Ooliba. Cambyses ruled over Scythia, in Iberia; styled Gogarene, by Strabo (xi.). (Calmet) --- The proper Scythia withstood all the attempts of his successors, and defeated Darius. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 38:4\ft Jaws. Thus Cambyses treated the son of Psammenites. God has the most absolute dominion over all monarchs, ver. 7.\f*
\f + \fr 38:8\ft Visited, or rather "shall visit" Judea. (Chaldean) (Grotius) --- Cambyses invaded Egypt twelve years after the Jews had returned, and came upon them two years later, designing to plunder them, at the instigation of their malevolent neighbours. He had sustained great losses in Egypt, and was arrived at Carmel when news was brought that the false Smerdis had declared himself king. See Herodotus 3:61.\f*
\f + \fr 38:12\ft Midst. Literally, "navel." Hebrew, "Thabor," intimating a mountain rising in a plain, Judges 9:7. (Calmet) --- Alluding to this intended blunder of the Jews lately returned, he speaks of Antichrist and of all heretics, who seek to pervert or suppress Catholics rescued from the power of the devil, by the sacraments of Christ. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 38:13\ft Tharsis. Septuagint, "Carthage, and all their villages." The merchants or naval forces of Cambyses spurred him forward, (see Psalm 77:6.) as well as the Arabs, Cuthites, etc., 1 Esdras 4:8. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 38:16\ft Latter. Antichrist shall persecute the Church at the end of the world. (Worthington) --- After Cambyses had punished Egypt, his turn came, and all his designs were baffled.\f*
\f + \fr 38:17\ft Prophets. See Isaias xiv., and 16:21., and 26:1., and Jeremias 30:3., and 23., and Joel 2:30., and 3:1., etc.\f*
\f + \fr 38:19\ft Israel. The Jews shall be full of dismay, (ver. 20.) as the tyrant will vent some threats; (Calmet) or this commotion was in his own army. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 38:21\ft Sword. The Jews were not in a condition to make resistance. (Calmet) --- Cambyses had his brother Smerdis slain. But another was set on the throne; whereupon, mounting his horse in a fury, he wounded himself with his sword in the thigh, which mortifying, caused his death after twenty days. (Herodotus 3:21., etc.) --- The historian does not mention what became of his army; but it seems to have perished by discord, as was very common among such a collection of nations. See Judges 7:22., and Judith 15:1., and 1 Kings 14:20., and 4 Kings 2:21. (Calmet) --- They were now without a head. (Haydock) --- In the whole universe, God will at last destroy Antichrist and all his adherents. (Worthington)\f*

\p
\v 1 And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal.
\p
\v 2 And I will turn thee round, and I will lead thee out, and will make thee go up from the northern parts; and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.
\p
\v 3 And I will break thy bow in thy left hand, and I will cause thy arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
\p
\v 4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou and all thy bands, and thy nations that are with thee: I have given thee to the wild beasts, to the birds, and to every fowl, and to the beasts of the earth to be devoured.
\p
\v 5 Thou shalt fall upon the face of the field; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 6 And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell confidently in the islands; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
\p
\v 7 And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and my holy name shall be profaned no more; and the Gentiles shall know that I am the Lord, the holy one of Israel.
\p
\v 8 Behold, it cometh, and it is done, saith the Lord God; this is the day whereof I have spoken.
\p
\v 9 And the inhabitants shall go forth of the cities of Israel, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, the shields, and the spears, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves and the pikes; and they shall burn them with fire seven years.
\p
\v 10 And they shall not bring wood out of the countries, nor cut down out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire, and shall make a prey of them to whom they had been a prey, and they shall rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give Gog a noted place for a sepulchre in Israel; the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea, which shall cause astonishment in them that pass by; and there shall they bury Gog, and all his multitude, and it shall be called the valley of the multitude of Gog.
\p
\v 12 And the house of Israel shall bury them for seven months, to cleanse the land.
\p
\v 13 And all the people of the land shall bury him, and it shall be unto them a noted day, wherein I was glorified, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 14 And they shall appoint men to go continually about the land, to bury and to seek out them that were remaining upon the face of the earth, that they may cleanse it; and after seven months they shall begin to seek.
\p
\v 15 And they shall go about passing through the land; and when they shall see the bone of a man, they shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers bury it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.
\p
\v 16 And the name of the city shall be Amona, and they shall cleanse the land.
\p
\v 17 And thou, O son of man, saith the Lord God, say to every fowl, and to all the birds, and to all the beasts of the field: Assemble yourselves, make haste, come together from every side to my victim, which I slay for you, a great victim upon the mountains of Israel: to eat flesh, and drink blood.
\p
\v 18 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and you shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth: of rams, and of lambs, and of he-goats, and bullocks, and of all that are well fed and fat.
\p
\v 19 And you shall eat the fat till you be full, and shall drink blood till you be drunk of the victim which I shall slay for you.
\p
\v 20 And you shall be filled at my table with horses, and mighty horsemen, and all the men of war, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 21 And I will set my glory among the nations; and all nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
\p
\v 22 And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God, from that day and forward.
\p
\v 23 And the nations shall know that the house of Israel were made captives for their iniquity, because they forsook me, and I hid my face from them: and I delivered them into the hands of their enemies, and they fell all by the sword.
\p
\v 24 I have dealt with them according to their uncleanness and wickedness, and hid my face from them.
\p
\v 25 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and will have mercy on all the house of Israel: and I will be jealous for my holy name.
\p
\v 26 And they shall bear their confusion, and all the transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against me, when they shall dwell in their land securely, fearing no man:
\p
\v 27 And I shall have brought them back from among the nations, and shall have gathered them together out of the lands of their enemies, and shall be sanctified in them, in the sight of many nations.
\p
\v 28 *And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, because I caused them to be carried away among the nations; and I have gathered them together unto their own land, and have not left any of them there.

The Jews immediately after his death recommence the building of the temple, (1 Esdras iv.; Aggeus 1:14.) which they are forced to discontinue, till Hystaspes confirmed the decree of Cyrus. This was the grand object of their desires, and therefore the day when Cambyses fell was ever memorable to them. (Calmet, Diss.) --- So will that be for Christians, when Antichrist shall be no more.

\cd The prophet sees in a vision the rebuilding of the temple: the dimensions of several parts thereof.
\p
\v 1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, the tenth day of the month, the fourteenth year *after the city was destroyed: in the self-same day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me thither.
\p
\v 2 In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain: upon which there was as the building of a city, bending towards the south.
\p
\v 3 And he brought me in thither: and behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand: and he stood in the gate.
\p
\v 4 And this man said to me: Son of man, see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee: for thou art brought hither that they may be shewn to thee: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.
\p
\v 5 And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a hand breadth: and he measured the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed.
\p
\v 6 And he came to the gate that looked toward the east, and he went up the steps thereof: and he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate one reed; that is, one threshold was one reed broad:
\p
\v 7 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad: and between the little chambers were five cubits:
\p
\v 8 And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within, was one reed.
\p
\v 9 And he measured the porch of the gate eight cubits, and the front thereof two cubits: and the porch of the gate was inward.
\p
\v 10 And the little chambers of the gate that looked eastward were three on this side, and three on that side: all three were of one measure, and the fronts of one measure, on both parts.
\p
\v 11 And he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate ten cubits: and the length of the gate thirteen cubits:
\p
\v 12 And the border before the little chambers one cubit: and one cubit was the border on both sides: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side and that side.
\p
\v 13 And he measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another, in breadth five and twenty cubits: door against door.
\p
\v 14 He made also fronts of sixty cubits: and to the front the court of the gate on every side round about.
\p
\v 15 And before the face of the gate, which reached even to the face of the porch of the inner gate, fifty cubits.
\p
\v 16 And slanting windows in the little chambers, and in their fronts, which were within the gate on every side round about: and in like manner there were also in the porches windows round about within, and before the fronts the representation of palm-trees.
\p
\v 17 And he brought me into the outward court, and behold there were chambers, and a pavement of stone in the court round about: thirty chambers encompassed the pavement.
\p
\v 18 And the pavement in the front of the gates, according to the length of the gates, was lower.
\p
\v 19 And he measured the breadth, from the face of the lower gate to the front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, to the east, and to the north.
\p
\v 20 He measured also both the length and the breadth of the gate of the outward court, which looked northward.
\p
\v 21 And the little chambers thereof, three on this side, and three on that side; and the front thereof, and the porch thereof, according to the measure of the former gate, fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\p
\v 22 And the windows thereof, and the porch, and the gravings, according to the measure of the gate that looked to the east, and they went up to it by seven steps, and a porch was before it.
\p
\v 23 And the gate of the inner court was over-against the gate of the north, and that of the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.
\p
\v 24 And he brought me out to the way of the south, and behold the gate that looked to the south; and he measured the front thereof, and the porch thereof, according to the former measures.
\p
\v 25 And the windows thereof, and the porches round about, as the other windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.
\p
\v 26 And there were seven steps to go up to it; and a porch before the doors thereof; and there were graven palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, in the front thereof.
\p
\v 27 And there was a gate of the inner court towards the south; and he measured from gate to gate towards the south, a hundred cubits.
\p
\v 28 And he brought me into the inner court at the south gate; and he measured the gate according to the former measures.
\p
\v 29 The little chamber thereof and the front thereof, and the porch thereof, with the same measures; and the windows thereof, and the porch thereof, round about it, was fifty cubits in length, and five and twenty cubits in breadth.
\p
\v 30 And the porch round about was five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.
\p
\v 31 And the porch thereof to the outward court, and the palm-trees thereof in the front: and there were eight steps to go up to it.
\p
\v 32 And he brought me into the inner court by the way of the east; and he measured the gate according to the former measures.
\p
\v 33 The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the porch thereof as before; and the windows thereof, and the porches thereof, round about it, was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\p
\v 34 And the porch thereof, that is, of the outward court; and the graven palm-trees in the front thereof, on this side and on that side; and the going up thereof was by eight steps.
\p
\v 35 And he brought me into the gate that looked to the north; and he measured according to the former measures.
\p
\v 36 The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the porch thereof, and the windows thereof, round about it, was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.
\p
\v 37 And the porch thereof looked to the outward court; and the graving of palm-trees, in the front thereof, was on this side and on that side; and the going up to it was by eight steps.
\p
\v 38 And at every chamber was a door in the forefronts of the gates; there they washed the holocaust.
\p
\v 39 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side; that the holocaust, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering might be slain thereon.
\p
\v 40 And on the outward side, which goeth up to the entry of the gate that looketh toward the north, were two tables; and at the other side, before the porch of the gate, were two tables.
\p
\v 41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side: at the sides of the gate were eight tables, upon which they slew the victims.
\p
\v 42 And the four tables for the holocausts were made of square stones; one cubit and a half long, and one cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, to lay the vessels upon, in which the holocaust, and the victim is slain.
\p
\v 43 And the borders of them were of one handbreadth, turned inwards round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.
\p
\v 44 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singing men in the inner court, which was on the side of the gate that looketh to the north; and their prospect was towards the south, one at the side of the east gate, which looked toward the north.
\p
\v 45 And he said to me: This chamber, which looketh towards the south, shall be for the priests that watch in the wards of the temple.
\p
\v 46 But the chamber that looketh towards the north, shall be for the priests that watch over the ministry of the altar. These are the sons of Sadoc, who, among the sons of Levi, come near to the Lord, to minister to him.
\p
\v 47 And he measured the court a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, four square; and the altar that was before the face of the temple.
\p
\v 48 And he brought me into the porch of the temple; and he measured the porch five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
\p
\v 49 And the length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and there were eight steps to go up to it. And there were pillars in the fronts; one on this side, and another on that side.
\f + \fr 40:1\ft Year of the World 3430, Year before Christ 574.\f*
\f + \fr 40:1\ft Month; April 30, the year of the world 3430. (Usher) (Calmet) --- In explaining this last most obscure vision: 1:The Jews say it was verified after the captivity. But thus the temple would be four miles round, and the city thirty-six, which never was the case. 2:Hence more modern Jews assert it will be fulfilled by the Messias. 3:Rejecting these errors, Lyranus, etc., suppose that the promise was conditional, and that the sins of the Jews prevented the city and temple from being so large; and that the mystical temple of the Church is also insinuated, into which both Jews and Gentiles shall enter. 4:Though this opinion be probable, it seems better to follow St. Jerome, St. Gregory, etc., who cannot apply all to the Old Testament, nor think that such a huge temple and city were indeed promised, but explain some parts of the captives at their return, as a figure of those redeemed by Christ, and brought into his Church, which is adorned with all graces. Yet the greatest part must be understood of the Church triumphant. (Worthington) --- St. Jerome confesses his ignorance of this subject; and those who have come after him, though they imitate not his modesty, add little to dissipate the mist with which this vision is surrounded. Some have adhered too close to Josephus, while Villalpand has here discovered all the magnificence of Greek and Roman architecture, and has represented the temple six times as large as it really was. It seems that the prophet has described the same temple of Solomon which he had seen, that the dimensions might be preserved, and the hopes of the people kept up; (Calmet) and that they might comprehend what a loss they actually sustained on account of their sins, (Haydock) and might strive to come up to this pattern (Du Hamel) as "near as they should be able," the wealth of the people being much less than Solomon's. (Grotius) --- These arguments do not, however, shew that the buildings were to resemble each other. They vary in many particulars; and the prophet would specify what was to be really executed. He says nothing of the ornamental part, and little of the height, which are the most expensive. (Houbigant) (Preface) --- If some things appear to be too grand for the temple of Solomon, and of Zorobabel, we must reflect that the prophet passes from the figure to the Church of Christ, which is not unusual. (Menochius) --- Alcasar and Bossuet explain it wholly of the Church, so that the letter requires few notes. (Du Hamel)\f*
\f + \fr 40:2\ft Mountain; Moria, in spirit. On the eastern side, the road to the city was level. Walls were added after the captivity, on the other sides. (Josephus, Jewish Wars 6:6.) --- City, the temple was so large. --- South, to one coming from the north, though the temple lay on that side of the town, Psalm 47:2. (Calmet) --- Septuagint read mongod, "over-against," instead of mongob, "south," which has perplexed many. (Houbigant) --- Ezechiel was placed on Sion, which was not very high, but here it denotes the Church. Jerusalem was in ruins. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 40:3\ft Brass: shining. (Haydock) --- This angel waited for the prophet at the northern gate, but introduced him by that looking towards the east, ver. 16. --- Line. It seems never to have been used. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 40:5\ft Breadth. Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, "of six cubits, in a cubit and a palm;" intimating that the sacred cubit contained six palms, while the common one had only five, (chap. 43:13.; Worthington) being half a yard; (Arbuthnot) or the Hebrew cubit was a hand's breadth larger than the Babylonian, or about 21.5 inches, (Calmet) which may be styled (Menochius) the sacred cubit. (Arbuthnot) (Haydock) --- Reed. This outer wall (Calmet; Menochius) was to prevent any from falling down the precipice. It was about four yards nine inches in height and thickness, being so solid in order that the ground might not give way. Josephus describes prodigious walls, (Haydock) reaching to the bottom of the mountain, three hundred cubits on the south and west; but then the temple was much enlarged. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 40:6\ft And. In this verse occurs the first of thirty-four words where the j is allowed by the keri to be omitted in this one chapter, always when it is the sign of the plural number before a suffixed v, and of course by voluntary assimilation. But Camb. Manuscript has the j regularly in the thirty-two of these words. (Kennicott) --- Steps. The ground was not quite level, which caused the buildings to rise one above another more elegantly. There were four great gates.\f*

Interpreters disagree in their sentiments: but all allow that God here insinuated that he would reward people in the Old Testament with temporal, and those in the New with spiritual blessings; first with grace in this life, and with glory in the next.

\f + \fr 40:17\ft There were chambers. Gazophylacia, so called, because the priests and Levites kept in them the stores and vessels that belonged to the temple. (Challoner) --- They went all round the courts. The women were in the second story. Villalpand and Capel, who are deemed the most accurate, suppose that there were no chambers below, but an open gallery. There seem, however, to have been chambers also, Ezechiel 8:7. (Calmet)\f*

Hebrew seems corrupt, a being substituted for a. "They mounted by ten steps," as the Septuagint read. Aquila has eleven; Symmachus [has] eight. --- Pillars of brass, 3 Kings 7:15.

\cd A description of the temple, and of all the parts of it.
\p
\v 1 And he brought me into the temple, and he measured the fronts six cubits broad on this side, and six cubits on that side, the breadth of the tabernacle.
\p
\v 2 And the breadth of the gate was ten cubits; and the sides of the gate five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and he measured the length thereof forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\p
\v 3 Then going inward he measured the front of the gate two cubits; and the gate six cubits; and the breadth of the gate seven cubits.
\p
\v 4 And he measured the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, before the face of the temple; and he said to me: This is the holy of holies.
\p
\v 5 And he measured the wall of the house six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber four cubits round about the house on every side.
\p
\v 6 And the side-chambers one by another, were twice thirty-three; and they bore outwards, that they might enter in through the wall of the house in the sides round about, to hold in, and not to touch the wall of the temple.
\p
\v 7 And there was a broad passage round about, going up by winding stairs, and it led into the upper loft of the temple all round; therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts; and so from the lower parts they went to the higher by the midst.
\p
\v 8 And I saw in the house the height round about, the foundations of the side-chambers, which were the measure of a reed, the space of six cubits:
\p
\v 9 And the thickness of the wall for the side-chamber without, which was five cubits; and the inner house was within the side-chambers of the house.
\p
\v 10 And between the chambers was the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
\p
\v 11 And the door of the side-chambers was turned towards the place of prayer: one door was toward the north, and another door was toward the south: and the breadth of the place for prayer, was five cubits round about.
\p
\v 12 And the building that was separate, and turned to the way that looked toward the sea, was seventy cubits broad: and the wall of the building, five cubits thick round about: and ninety cubits long.
\p
\v 13 And he measured the length of the house, a hundred cubits: and the separate building, and the walls thereof, a hundred cubits in length.
\p
\v 14 And the breadth before the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.
\p
\v 15 And he measured the length of the building over-against it, which was separated at the back of it: and the galleries on both sides a hundred cubits: and the inner temple, and the porches of the court.
\p
\v 16 The thresholds, and the oblique windows, and the galleries round about on three sides, over-against the threshold of every one, and floored with wood all round about: and the ground was up to the windows, and the windows were shut over the doors.
\p
\v 17 And even to the inner house, and without all the wall round about, within and without, by measure.
\p
\v 18 And there were cherubims and palm-trees wrought, so that a palm-tree was between a cherub and a cherub, and every cherub had two faces.
\p
\v 19 The face of a man was toward the palm-tree on one side, and the face of a lion was toward the palm-tree on the other side: set forth through all the house round about.
\p
\v 20 From the ground even to the upper parts of the gate, were cherubims and palm-trees wrought in the wall of the temple.
\p
\v 21 The threshold was four-square, and the face of the sanctuary, sight to sight.
\p
\v 22 The altar of wood was three cubits high: and the length thereof was two cubits: and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood. And he said to me: This is the table before the Lord.
\p
\v 23 And there were two doors in the temple, and in the sanctuary.
\p
\v 24 And in the two doors on both sides were two little doors, which were folded within each other: for there were two wickets on both sides of the doors.
\p
\v 25 And there were cherubims also wrought in the doors of the temple, and the figures of palm-trees, like as were made on the walls: for which cause also the planks were thicker in the front of the porch without.
\p
\v 26 Upon which were the oblique windows, and the representation of palm-trees on this side, and on that side, in the sides of the porch, according to the sides of the house, and the breadth of the walls.
\f + \fr 41:1\ft The temple. This plan of a temple, which was here shewn to the prophet in a vision, partly had relation to the material temple, which was to be rebuilt: and partly, in a mystical sense, to the spiritual temple of God, the Church of Christ. (Challoner) --- The description seems grander than Solomon's; and yet Zorobabel's temple was meaner than his. Hence this prophecy, and those of Aggeus and Zacharias, cannot be understood of it, but of the Church. (St. Jerome; St. Augustine, City of God 18:45.) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 41:3\ft Front, or door-posts. The temple was 20 cubits broad.\f*
\f + \fr 41:5\ft Four. Herein it differed from Solomon's chambers, which were in breadth five, six, and seven cubits, in the three stories, respectively. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 41:6\ft One by another, or one over another: literally, side to side, or side upon side. (Challoner) --- The word side is here equivocal, like Hebrew tsela, sometimes denoting the boards, and at other times the apartments round the temple, except on the west, over against the sanctuary, which seems to be the case here. It is true, we shall not easily find sixty-six chambers. But the Hebrew, etc., have only thirty-three. (Calmet) --- Villalpand rightly translated anterides, (ver. 5.) but here he substitutes trabes, "beams or thick planks," to make it agree with 3 Kings 6:6., as if the same temple were meant. He also adopts the Vulgate bis. --- Twice. Hebrew pehamim. Yet he afterwards places in his commentary, pedes, "thirty-three feet, that is twenty-two cubits," though feet are never used at all as a measure in Scripture. (Houbigant)\f*
\f + \fr 41:7\ft Broader, as the wall was not so thick. (Haydock) --- Midst. The two staircases were round in the hollow of the wall, (Menochius) at the eastern end of the chambers. (Josephus) See 3 Kings. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 41:9\ft House. Because these side-chambers were in the very walls of the temple all around: or it may also be rendered, (more agreeably to the Hebrew) so as to signify, that the thickness of the wall for the side-chambers within was the same as that of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits. (Challoner) --- Protestants, "and that which was left, was the place of the side-chambers that were within." (Haydock) --- To manifest a greater respect for God, the apartments of the priests were twenty-five cubits distant from the temple, (ver. 10.) and divided by a wall, which Josephus describes as three cubits high. (Antiquities 8:2.) This wall was at the distance of five cubits from the temple. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 41:11\ft Prayer, or "separated;" munnach, (Haydock) the inner house, ver. 9.\f*
\f + \fr 41:13\ft Separate, different from that [in] ver. 9., (Calmet; Hebrew gizra.; Haydock) between the temple and the priests' apartments, which it may also designate, (Calmet) unless it (Haydock) mean the temple itself, which was divided from the rest, (Menochius) and set aside for prayer, etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 41:15\ft Galleries; Ethecas, or as the more correct manuscripts of St. Jerome read, Ecthetas, seems to be formed from (Calmet) Hebrew athikim, (Haydock) which St. Jerome explains a balcony, portico, or gallery.\f*
\f + \fr 41:16\ft About. Thus he intimates the inner temple, which was covered with boards. --- Windows. The temple was hidden so far by the chambers; or rather he measured (Calmet) "the ground and up to the windows, which were" shut up with lattices, affording light over the doors (Haydock) and apartments, fifteen cubits from the ground.\f*
\f + \fr 41:18\ft Two. Before he describes them with four faces. But they varied, (Exodus 25:18.) or the other two might be against the wall. (Calmet) --- The cherub signified "knowledge," and the palm-tree victory, to shew that man must be instructed with divine knowledge, and so fight for the victory. The face of man implied that Christ would suffer, and that of a lion announced that he would overcome all his enemies. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 41:21\ft The threshold was four-square. That is, the gate of the temple was four-square, and so placed as to answer the gate of the sanctuary within. (Challoner) --- It was not an arch, though not a perfect square, 3 Kings 6:34.\f*
\f + \fr 41:22\ft Table, or altar of incense, larger than that of Moses, Exodus 30:1.\f*
\f + \fr 41:23\ft Sanctuary. One folding door opened into it, the other into the temple.\f*
\f + \fr 41:24\ft Other. It was not perhaps necessary to open the large door.\f*
\f + \fr 41:26\ft Sides, (humerulis) or pilasters. Hebrew, "on the shoulder of the porch, and on the sides of the house, and beams." (Calmet)\f*

\cd A description of the courts, chambers, and other places belonging to the temple.
\p
\v 1 And he brought me forth into the outward court, by the way that leadeth to the north, and he brought me into the chamber that was over-against the separate building, and over-against the house toward the north.
\p
\v 2 In the face of the north door was the length of a hundred cubits: and the breadth of fifty cubits.
\p
\v 3 Over-against the twenty cubits of the inner court, and over-against the pavement of the outward court that was paved with stone, where there was a gallery joined to a triple gallery.
\p
\v 4 And before the chambers was a walk ten cubits broad, looking to the inner parts of a way of one cubit. And their doors were toward the north:
\p
\v 5 Where were the store-chambers lower above: because they bore up the galleries, which appeared above out of them from the lower parts, and from the midst of the building.
\p
\v 6 For they were of three stories, and had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts: therefore did they appear above out of the lower places, and out of the middle places, fifty cubits from the ground.
\p
\v 7 And the outward wall that went about by the chambers, which were towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers, was fifty cubits long.
\p
\v 8 For the length of the chambers of the outward court was fifty cubits: and the length before the face of the temple, a hundred cubits.
\p
\v 9 And there was under these chambers, an entrance from the east, for them that went into them out of the outward court.
\p
\v 10 In the breadth of the outward wall of the court that was toward the east, over-against the separate building, and there were chambers before the building.
\p
\v 11 And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward the north: they were as long as they, and as broad as they: and all the going is to them, and their fashions, and their doors were alike.
\p
\v 12 According to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south: there was a door in the head of the way, which way was before the porch, separated towards the east as one entereth in.
\p
\v 13 And he said to me: The chambers of the north, and the chambers of the south, which are before the separate building: they are holy chambers, in which the priests shall eat, that approach to the Lord into the holy of holies: there they shall lay the most holy things, and the offering for sin, and for trespass: for it is a holy place.
\p
\v 14 And when the priests shall have entered in, they shall not go out of the holy places into the outward court: but there they shall lay their vestments, wherein they minister, for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and so they shall go forth to the people.
\p
\v 15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east: and he measured it on every side round about.
\p
\v 16 And he measured toward the east, with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
\p
\v 17 And he measured toward the north, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\p
\v 18 And towards the south he measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
\p
\v 19 And toward the west he measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
\p
\v 20 By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side round about, five hundred cubits long, and five hundred cubits broad, making a separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people.
\f + \fr 42:1\ft And. St. Jerome finding the Septuagint and others varying in the explanations, gives his own; yet adopts the saying of Socrates, "I know that I am ignorant:" for this also is a part of science. (Worthington) --- Outward, with respect to the temple. It is styled inner court, with reference to that of the people. --- Separate. Ezechiel 41:9.\f*
\f + \fr 42:3\ft Triple, one over another, (ver. 6.) or on a level with the priests' court.\f*
\f + \fr 42:4\ft One cubit, projecting out perhaps for seats, or for the pilasters.\f*
\f + \fr 42:5\ft Above. The higher stories are not so lofty.\f*
\f + \fr 42:6\ft Fifty cubits. We only allow thirty, as this is not in Hebrew, etc. The text, ver. 10., and 12., seems incorrect. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 42:13\ft Holies. Hebrew, "who are very holy," and (Haydock) on duty. See Leviticus 6:25.\f*
\f + \fr 42:14\ft People. Ezechiel 44:17., and Exodus 33:42. Christian priests use their vestments only when they are officiating. (Durand and Durant Rit. 2:9.) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 42:16\ft Five. Hebrew emoth should be meoth, "three hundred, as it is printed (yet not in the Protestant version. Haydock) thrice just after, and as it is written here in Manuscript 4. Camb. 1. 2." (Kennicott) --- Reeds. Septuagint, "cubits," as Hebrew, St. Jerome, etc., insinuate. The mountain was only five hundred paces square, even when it was enlarged in the time of Josephus. (Jewish Wars 6:14.; Greek) --- We must therefore read cubits. (Calmet) --- If we retain reeds, (Haydock) the wall will be twelve thousand cubits, (Menochius) which seems improbable. (Tournemine) See Ezechiel 45. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 42:20\ft Cubits. This confirms the former correction, ver. 16. (Haydock) --- Hebrew has only, "of five hundred." Maldonat and Cornelius a Lapide would understand reeds, to agree with what goes before. (Menochius) --- Separation. Josephus mentions a wall three cubits high, on the pillars of which was written in Greek and Latin, that such as entered the temple must be pure, (Calmet) and no stranger. (Haydock) --- Into this court all might come. (Philo) (Calmet)\f*

\cd The glory of God returns to the new temple. The Israelites shall no more profane God's name by idolatry: the prophet is commanded to shew them the dimensions, and form of the temple, and of the altar, with the sacrifices to be offered thereon.
\p
\v 1 And he brought me to the gate that looked towards the east.
\p
\v 2 And behold the glory of the God of Israel came in by the way of the east: and his voice was like the noise of many waters, and the earth shone with his majesty.
\p
\v 3 *And I saw the vision according to the appearance which I had seen when he came to destroy the city: and the appearance was according to the vision **which I had seen by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.
\p
\v 4 And the majesty of the Lord went into the temple by the way of the gate that looked to the east.
\p
\v 5 And the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court: and behold the house was filled with the glory of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 And I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and the man that stood by me,
\p
\v 7 Said to me: Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever: and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy name, they and their kings by their fornications, and by the carcasses of their kings, and by the high places.
\p
\v 8 They who have set their threshold by my threshold, and their posts by my posts: and there was but a wall between me and them: and they profaned my holy name by the abominations which they committed: for which reason I consumed them in my wrath.
\p
\v 9 Now, therefore, let them put away their fornications, and the carcasses of their kings far from me: and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
\p
\v 10 But thou, son of man, shew to the house of Israel the temple, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the building:
\p
\v 11 And be ashamed of all that they have done. Shew them the form of the house, and of the fashion thereof, the goings out, and the comings in, and the whole plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and all its order, and all its laws, and thou shalt write it in their sight: that they may keep the whole form thereof, and its ordinances, and do them.
\p
\v 12 This is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain: All its border round about is most holy; this then is the law of the house.
\p
\v 13 And these are the measures of the altar by the truest cubit, which is a cubit and a hand breadth: the bottom thereof was a cubit, and the breadth a cubit: and the border thereof unto its edge, and round about, one hand breadth: and this was the trench of the altar.
\p
\v 14 And from the bottom of the ground to the lowest brim two cubits, and the breadth of one cubit: and from the lesser brim to the greater brim four cubits, and the breadth of one cubit.
\p
\v 15 And the ariel itself was four cubits: and from the ariel upward were four horns.
\p
\v 16 And the ariel was twelve cubits long, and twelve cubits broad, four-square, with equal sides.
\p
\v 17 And the brim was fourteen cubits long, and fourteen cubits broad in the four corners thereof: and the crown round about it was half a cubit, and the bottom of it one cubit round about: and its steps turned toward the east.
\p
\v 18 And he said to me: Son of man, thus saith the Lord God: These are the ceremonies of the altar, in what day soever it shall be made: that holocausts may be offered upon it, and blood poured out.
\p
\v 19 And thou shalt give to the priests, and the Levites, that are of the race of Sadoc, who approach to me, saith the Lord God, to offer to me a calf of the herd for sin.
\p
\v 20 And thou shalt take of his blood, and shalt put it upon the four horns thereof, and upon the four corners of the brim, and upon the crown round about: and thou shalt cleanse, and expiate it.
\p
\v 21 And thou shalt take the calf, that is offered for sin: and thou shalt burn him in a separate place of the house without the sanctuary.
\p
\v 22 And in the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for sin: and they shall expiate the altar, as they expiated it with the calf.
\p
\v 23 And when thou shalt have made an end of the expiation thereof, thou shalt offer a calf of the herd without blemish, and a ram of the flock without blemish.
\p
\v 24 And thou shalt offer them in the sight of the Lord: and the priests shall put salt upon them, and shall offer them a holocaust to the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Seven days shalt thou offer a he-goat for sin daily: they shall offer also a calf of the herd, and a ram of the flock without blemish.
\p
\v 26 Seven days shall they expiate the altar, and shall cleanse it: and they shall consecrate it.
\p
\v 27 And the days being expired, on the eighth day and thence forward, the priests shall offer your holocausts upon the altar, and the peace-offerings: and I will be pacified towards you, saith the Lord God.

The world is enlightened by the preaching of the gospel; and the Church triumphant shall shine in perfection, when that which is sown in corruption shall put on incorruption, 1 Corinthians xv. (St. Jerome) --- The blessed Virgin [Mary] conceiving Jesus Christ may be insinuated. (St. Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologiae] p. 3. q. 27. a. 3.) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 43:3\ft He came. Hebrew, "I came to destroy (Septuagint, to anoint) the city," marking such as should be spared, Ezechiel 9. The glorious chariot entered by the eastern gate, and the prophet followed to the court of the priests, ver. 5, 13. (Calmet) --- The Jews say the second temple was deprived of the Shekinah, or glory of the Lord. Yet it seems here to enter; and Christ himself adorned this second house, more than the first, by his adorable presence, Aggeus 2:8. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 43:7\ft Said. The Lord spoke, (Chaldean; Theodoret) or the angel, (St. Jerome) in human shape. (Haydock) --- He addresses the prophet, ver. 12 to Ezechiel 44:5., though what follows immediately seems to belong to the Lord, (Calmet) in whose name he speaks. --- Name. God hath abandoned the synagogue, but will remain with his Church unto the end, Matthew 23:38., and 28:20. Yet the perfect Church, without spot, is the [Church] triumphant [in heaven]; (Ephesians 5:27.; Worthington) though the Catholic Church, on earth, is ever holy and "the communion of saints." (Haydock) --- Carcasses. Idols, according to some; or rather by the kings being buried on Sion. This is nowhere else reprehended; neither is their building too near the temple, which the prophet here condemns, ver. 8. (Calmet) --- It seems, however, that if these things had been blameable, such a number of pious and wise kings would not have acted thus, nor the prophets have neglected to admonish them of their duty. The carcasses and houses here specified may have been vestiges of idolatry; or, in future, the tombs and palaces were to be at a more respectful distance. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 43:8\ft Wall. The kings of Juda had a door communicating with the temple, by which they entered on the west. It was guarded by Levites, 1 Paralipomenon 26:16. Ezechiel places no door on that side. Yet in Herod's temple we find one leading to the adjacent palace, and three others into the town. (Josephus, Antiquities 15:14.)\f*
\f + \fr 43:9\ft Carcasses. Literally, "ruins." (Haydock) --- The remains of the dead were probably not disturbed; but no more, that we know of, were placed on Sion. (Calmet) --- Kings may signify idols, Moloc, etc., which they had worshipped, and which some had even placed in the holy place, to the nation's ruin. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 43:10\ft Measure, that they may be convinced of their ingratitude, (Menochius) which has deprived them of so noble a structure, and put them under the necessity of beginning so great a work again. It required all the exertions of the prophets to make them go forward with it, Aggeus 1. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 43:11\ft In the whole fabric, (Menochius) as thou hast described it, (Haydock) or received from the angel, with all the ceremonies to be observed.\f*
\f + \fr 43:12\ft Border. Nothing but the temple shall be on this mountain. It shall be wholly consecrated to the Lord. This was ill observed. The Asmonean princes erected the famous tower Antonia, at the north side. (Josephus) See ver. 8. The Jews assert that it was unlawful to spit on this ground, etc., but no such thing is specified in Josephus or in Scripture, only we find that none were to go out by the same door at which they had entered, (chap. 46:9.; Calmet) except the king.\f*
\f + \fr 43:13\ft By. Hebrew, "by cubits." This cubit is a common cubit, etc. The Babylonian, (Haydock) or sacred one, was a palm longer. (Worthington) (Chap. 40:5.) --- Breadth. It was the same as the depth, being designed to convey the blood by a conduit to the torrent Cedron. --- Trench, or bottom aforesaid. Septuagint, "the height." (Haydock) --- Chaldean, "disposition of the altar," which seems best.\f*
\f + \fr 43:14\ft Cubit. They were each a cubit broad, but this greater means higher up. Some assert that the priests stood on this base to avoid treading on the altar, when they placed the wood or victims. But it would be too low; and steps were made for that purpose. The altar was ten, or rather twelve cubits high, and as many broad. Solomon's was ten high and twenty broad. Herod's was a square of forty cubits, raised fifteen from the ground. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 43:15\ft The ariel. That is, the altar itself, or rather the highest part of it, upon which the burnt-offerings were laid. In the Hebrew it is harel, that is, the mountain of God; but in the following verse haariel, that is, the lion of God; a figure, from its consuming, and as it were devouring the sacrifices as a lion devours its prey. (Challoner) --- Fire descending sometimes from heaven. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- It also appeared like a little mountain in the court. See Isaias 29:1. The altar was probably made of brass, like Solomon's. Josephus and Philo say that rough stones were used after the captivity: but it seems little attention was paid to the dimensions of the temple, etc., given by Ezechiel. (Calmet) --- Yet the prophets were present to see the laws of God executed, and never complain of their infringement in these particulars, which were attended with no great difficulty, Ezechiel 40:1.

\cd The east gate of the sanctuary shall be always shut. The uncircumcised shall not enter into the sanctuary: nor the Levites that have served idols: but the sons of Sadoc shall do the priestly functions, who stood firm in the worst of times.
\p
\v 1 And he brought me back to the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary, which looked towards the east: and it was shut.
\p
\v 2 And the Lord said to me: This gate shall be shut: it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it: because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, and it shall be shut.
\p
\v 3 For the prince. The prince himself shall sit in it, to eat bread before the Lord: he shall enter in by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the same way.
\p
\v 4 And he brought me by the way of the north gate in the sight of the house: and I saw, and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord: and I fell on my face.
\p
\v 5 And the Lord said to me: Son of man, attend with thy heart, and behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears all that I say to thee concerning all the ceremonies of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the laws thereof: and mark well the ways of the temple, with all the goings out of the sanctuary.
\p
\v 6 And thou shalt say to the house of Israel, that provoketh me: Thus saith the Lord God: Let all your wicked doings suffice you, O house of Israel:
\p
\v 7 In that you have brought in strangers uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, and to defile my house: and you offer my bread, the fat, and the blood: and you have broken my covenant by all your wicked doings.
\p
\v 8 And you have not kept the ordinances of my sanctuary: but you have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the Lord God: No stranger uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, no stranger that is in the midst of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 10 Moreover, the Levites that went away far from me, when the children of Israel went astray, and have wandered from me after their idols, and have borne their iniquity:
\p
\v 11 They shall be officers in my sanctuary, and door-keepers of the gates of the house, and ministers to the house: they shall slay the holocausts, and the victims of the people: and they shall stand in their sight, to minister to them.
\p
\v 12 Because they ministered to them before their idols, and were a stumbling-block of iniquity to the house of Israel: therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity:
\p
\v 13 And they shall not come near to me, to do the office of priest to me, neither shall they come near to any of my holy things that are by the holy of holies: but they shall bear their shame, and their wickednesses which they have committed.
\p
\v 14 And I will make them door-keepers of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.
\p
\v 15 But the priests, and Levites, the sons of Sadoc, who kept the ceremonies of my sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me, to minister to me: and they shall stand before me, to offer me the fat, and the blood, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 16 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and to keep my ceremonies.
\p
\v 17 And when they shall enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments: neither shall any woollen come upon them, when they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.
\p
\v 18 They shall have linen mitres on their heads, and linen breeches on their loins, and they shall not be girded with any thing that causeth sweat.
\p
\v 19 And when they shall go forth to the outward court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them up in the store chamber of the sanctuary, and they shall clothe themselves with other garments: and they shall not sanctify the people with their vestments.
\p
\v 20 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor wear long hair: but they shall only poll their heads.
\p
\v 21 And no priest shall drink wine when he is to go into the inner court.
\p
\v 22 *Neither shall they take to wife a widow, nor one that is divorced, but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel: but they may take a widow also, that is the widow of a priest.
\p
\v 23 And they shall teach my people the difference between holy and profane, and shew them how to discern between clean and unclean.
\p
\v 24 And when there shall be a controversy, they shall stand in my judgments, and shall judge: they shall keep my laws, and my ordinances in all my solemnities, and sanctify my sabbaths.
\p
\v 25 And they shall come near no dead person, lest they be defiled, only their father and mother, and son and daughter, and brother and sister, that hath not had another husband: for whom they may become unclean.
\p
\v 26 And after one is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
\p
\v 27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary to the inner court, to minister unto me in the sanctuary, he shall offer for his sin, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 28 *And they shall have no inheritance, I am their inheritance: neither shall you give them any possession in Israel, for I am their possession.
\p
\v 29 They shall eat the victim both for sin and for trespass: and every vowed thing in Israel shall be theirs.
\p
\v 30 *And the first-fruits of all the first-born, and all the libations of all things that are offered, shall be the priest's: and you shall give the first-fruits of your meats to the priest, that he may return a blessing upon thy house.

Some (Haydock) kings of Juda claimed the privilege of entering by it at any time, and passed through a part of the court assigned to the priests, 2 Paralipomenon 6:12., and 4 Kings 16:18. This shall be no longer tolerated. The gate might be opened in the week days if the prince wished to offer sacrifice, but not else, except on the sabbaths, Ezechiel 46:1, 12. --- Lord, in peace offerings and religious feasts. --- Porch.

\cd Portions of land for the sanctuary, for the city, and for the prince. Ordinances for the prince.
\p
\v 1 And when you shall begin to divide the land by lot, separate ye first-fruits to the Lord, a portion of the land to be holy, in length twenty-five thousand and in breadth ten thousand: it shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.
\p
\v 2 And there shall be for the sanctuary on every side five hundred by five hundred, four-square round about: and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.
\p
\v 3 And with this measure thou shalt measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand, and in it shall be the temple, and the holy of holies.
\p
\v 4 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to the ministry of the Lord: and it shall be a place for their houses, and for the holy place of the sanctuary.
\p
\v 5 And five and twenty thousand of length, and ten thousand of breadth shall be for the Levites, that minister in the house: they shall possess twenty store-chambers.
\p
\v 6 And you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, according to the separation of the sanctuary, for the whole house of Israel.
\p
\v 7 For the prince also on the one side and on the other side, according to the separation of the sanctuary, and according to the possession of the city, over-against the separation of the sanctuary, and over-against the possession of the city: from the side of the sea even to the sea, and from the side of the east even to the east. And the length according to every part from the west border to the east border.
\p
\v 8 He shall have a portion of the land in Israel: and the princes shall no more rob my people: but they shall give the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the Lord God: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: cease from iniquity and robberies, and execute judgment and justice, separate your confines from my people, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 10 You shall have just balances, and a just ephi, and a just bate.
\p
\v 11 The ephi and the bate shall be equal, and of one measure: that the bate may contain the tenth part of a core, and the ephi the tenth part of a core: their weight shall be equal according to the measure of a core.
\p
\v 12 *And the sicle hath twenty obols. Now twenty sicles, and five and twenty sicles, and fifteen sicles make a mna.
\p
\v 13 And these are the first-fruits, which you shall take: the sixth part of an ephi of a core of wheat, and the sixth part of an ephi of a core of barley.
\p
\v 14 The measure of oil also, a bate of oil is the tenth part of a core: and ten bates make a core: for ten bates fill a core.
\p
\v 15 And one ram out of a flock of two hundred, of those that Israel feedeth for sacrifice, and for holocausts, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 16 All the people of the land shall be bound to these first-fruits, for the prince in Israel.
\p
\v 17 And the prince shall give the holocaust, and the sacrifice, and the libations on the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, and on all the solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall offer the sacrifice for sin, and the holocaust, and the peace-offerings, to make expiation for the house of Israel.
\p
\v 18 Thus saith the Lord God: In the first month, the first of the month, thou shalt take a calf of the herd, without blemish, and thou shalt expiate the sanctuary.
\p
\v 19 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering: and he shall put it on the posts of the house, and on the four corners of the brim of the altar, and on the posts of the gate of the inner court.
\p
\v 20 And so shalt thou do in the seventh day of the month, for every one that hath been ignorant, and hath been deceived by error, and thou shalt make expiation for the house.
\p
\v 21 In the first month, the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the solemnity of the Pasch: seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten.
\p
\v 22 And the prince on that day shall offer for himself, and for all the people of the land, a calf for sin.
\p
\v 23 And in the solemnity of the seven days he shall offer for a holocaust to the Lord, seven calves, and seven rams without blemish daily, for seven days: and for sin a he-goat daily.
\p
\v 24 And he shall offer the sacrifice of an ephi for every calf, and an ephi for every ram: and a hin of oil for every ephi.
\p
\v 25 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the solemn feast, he shall do the like for the seven days: as well in regard to the sin-offering, as to the holocaust, and the sacrifice, and the oil.

\f + \fr 45:1\ft By lot. Manuscript 2 reads bogurl; (printed benachala) so the Vulgate sortito. (Kennicott) --- Hebrew, "when you shall make the land fall," which usually implies by lot: yet the partition was not made thus, (chap. 48:1.) nor at all, (Calmet) otherwise the prophet might mention how the lots would have fallen to Dan, in the north, etc. (Haydock) --- The Jews either could not comply, or did not take this to be a command. If they had returned all together, they might probably have put it in execution. But many of them preferred staying where they had gotten a settlement, and the rest only returned in small parties, some not before the reign of Alexander [the Great]. Those who arrived first, occupied as much as possible their ancient limits, 1 Esdras 3:1., and 2 Esdras viii., and xi. (Calmet) --- Thousand: reeds, or cubits. (Challoner) --- Many prefer the latter, which is specified [in] ver. 2., (Haydock) as it agrees with the dimensions of the temple, Ezechiel 42:16. If reeds or toises were meant, the city would be disproportionate with the rest of the divisions: 50,000 would make 25 leagues, of 2,500 paces each; and if each tribe had as much, the country must have comprised 325 leagues, whereas from Emath to Cadesbarne (chap. 47:17.) there at[are?] not above 150. (Calmet) --- To form an idea of the proposed partition, we must suppose the country reached from a little north of Emesa, on the Orontes, to Cadesbarne south, and from the Mediterranean to Damascus, or a little farther east, and beyond the sources of Jazer. 1. Dan, 2. Aser, 3. Nephthali, 4. Manasses, 5. Ephraim, 6. Ruben, and 7. Juda, had about equal portions with that designed for 8. the temple, the Levites, and prince, whose southern limits reached almost to Accaron and the Dead Sea. 9. Benjamin, 10. Simeon, 11. Issachar, 12. Zabulon, and 13. Gad, had each about half the quantity of the others, though the tribes occupied the whole extent from east to west, their lots being marked out by parallel lines. Between Juda and Benjamin, a square of 500 cubits was assigned for the temple; another square of 4,500, or 18,000 in circuit, lay round the former for the city of the Levites: round this were suburbs 250 cubits broad, walled about, and having three gates on each side. Next them dwelt their lay servants, in a space 5,000 cubits broad, and 25,000 long, from east to west. A plot of ground on the north and south, sufficient to complete this square was to support them with provisions. On the east side of the Jordan, and on the west of this square for the priests and their servants, two portions almost of equal dimensions with it, were appropriated to the prince. His lot was 25,000 cubits long, and 12,500 broad, Ezechiel 48:21. See Calmet's plan. (Haydock) --- About. It could not be alienated to private men, or for any other purpose. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 45:2\ft Suburbs. Hebrew also, "vacant spaces."\f*

\f + \fr 45:5\ft Chambers for the Levites on duty. Septuagint read, "towns." But only one seems to be specified, 18,000 cubits in circumference.\f*
\f + \fr 45:6\ft According. Hebrew, "along or (Calmet) over-against the oblation of the holy portion." (Protestants) --- Israel, destined to serve the priests. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 45:7\ft Border. Two equal lots, one on the east and the other on the west, were assigned the prince, each 20,000 cubits broad, and 12,500 long, Ezechiel 48:21. (Calmet) --- He dwelt near the priests, for their protection; as the people were on both sides of him, that he might sustain no injury. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 45:8\ft Rob. Instead of their right, (1 Kings 8:11.) the source of continual vexations, a certain revenue is specified, ver. 13.\f*
\f + \fr 45:9\ft Confines: encroach not. (Calmet) --- Hebrew and Septuagint, "take away your oppressions;" (Haydock) Chaldean, "scandals." (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 45:11\ft The ephi and the bate. These measures were of equal capacity; but the bate served for liquids, and the ephi for dry things, (Challoner) ver. 13, 14. (Worthington) --- Ezechiel specifies the measures, that the people might not use those of Babylon, after their return.\f*
\f + \fr 45:12\ft Sicles. It would be shorter to say, "sixty sicles make a mna."\f*
\f + \fr 45:13\ft Take, for the prince's revenue. He had the sixtieth part of corn and of oil; or rather (Calmet) he had an exact tithe of the latter, ver. 14. (Chaldean) (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 45:15\ft One ram. He shall receive the tithe of sheep, etc., and take one out of two hundred, on condition that he furnish victims, ver. 17. (Calmet) --- The obligation was mutual. St. Jerome explains it of the high priest and people. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 45:17\ft Holocaust. This was given before perhaps gratis, 2 Paralipomenon 31:3. Solomon and Ezechias shewed great magnificence. After the captivity the people laid on the third of a sicle per head, as this order was not observed, 2 Esdras 10:32.\f*
\f + \fr 45:18\ft Take, or order the priests to do this annually, to prepare for the Passover, ver. 21. Moses mentions nothing of this, and it does not appear to have been put in execution. (Calmet) --- Yet it might be the first year after the dedication of the temple. The prophet does not say it was to be done every year. (Haydock)\f*

\v 1 Thus saith the Lord God: The gate of the inner court, that looketh toward the east, shall be shut the six days on which work is done; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened; yea, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
\p
\v 2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate from without, and he shall stand at the threshold of the gate: and the priests shall offer his holocaust, and his peace-offerings: and he shall adore upon the threshold of the gate, and shall go out: but the gate shall not be shut till the evening.
\p
\v 3 And the people of the land shall adore at the door of that gate before the Lord, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons.
\p
\v 4 And the holocaust that the prince shall offer to the Lord on the sabbath day, shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
\p
\v 5 And the sacrifice of an ephi for a ram: but for the lambs what sacrifice his hand shall allow: and a hin of oil for every ephi.
\p
\v 6 And on the day of the new moon a calf of the herd without blemish: and the six lambs, and the rams shall be without blemish.
\p
\v 7 And he shall offer in sacrifice an ephi for a calf, an ephi also for a ram: but for the lambs, as his hand shall find: and a hin of oil for every ephi.
\p
\v 8 And when the prince is to go in, let him go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and let him go out the same way.
\p
\v 9 But when the people of the land shall go in before the Lord, in the solemn feasts, he that goeth in by the north gate to adore, shall go out by the way of the south gate: and he that goeth in by the way of the south gate, shall go out by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go out at that over-against it.
\p
\v 10 And the prince in the midst of them, shall go in when they go in, and go out when they go out.
\p
\v 11 And in the fairs, and in the solemnities, there shall be the sacrifice of an ephi to a calf, and an ephi to a ram: and to the lambs, the sacrifice shall be as his hand shall find: and a hin of oil to every ephi.
\p
\v 12 But when the prince shall offer a voluntary holocaust, or voluntary peace-offerings to the Lord: the gate that looketh towards the east shall be opened to him, and he shall offer his holocaust, and his peace-offerings, as it is wont to be done on the sabbath day: and he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he is gone forth.
\p
\v 13 And he shall offer every day for a holocaust to the Lord, a lamb of the same year without blemish: he shall offer it always in the morning.
\p
\v 14 And he shall offer the sacrifice for it morning by morning, the sixth part of ephi: and the third part of a bin of oil, to be mingled with the fine flour: a sacrifice to the Lord by ordinance, continual and everlasting.
\p
\v 15 He shall offer the lamb, and the sacrifice, and the oil, morning by morning: an everlasting holocaust.
\p
\v 16 Thus saith the Lord God: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons: the inheritance of it shall go to his children, they shall possess it by inheritance.
\p
\v 17 But if he give a legacy out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of release, and it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall go to his sons.
\p
\v 18 And the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by violence, nor of their possession: but out of his own possession he shall give an inheritance to his sons: that my people be not dispersed every man from his possession.
\p
\v 19 And he brought me in by the entry, that was at the side of the gate, into the chambers of the sanctuary that were for the priests, which looked toward the north. And there was a place bending to the west.
\p
\v 20 And he said to me: This is the place where the priests shall boil the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering: where they shall dress the sacrifice, that they may not bring it out into the outward court, and the people be sanctified.
\p
\v 21 And he brought me into the outward court, and he led me about by the four corners of the court: and behold there was a little court in the corner of the court, to every corner of the court there was a little court.
\p
\v 22 In the four corners of the court were little courts disposed, forty cubits long, and thirty broad: all the four were of one measure.

\v 23 And there was a wall round about compassing the four little courts, and there were kitchens built under the rows round about.

\v 24 And he said to me: This is the house of the kitchens wherein the ministers of the house of the Lord shall boil the victims of the people.
\f + \fr 46:2\ft Prince. After the captivity, although the race of David continued in Salathiel, Zorobabel, etc., yet they had not the state of kings. Hence Christians, R. David and other Jews, understand this of the Messias and the rites of his Church, with a literal allusion to the old law. (Worthington) --- Without, not proceeding into the court of the priests, Ezechiel 44:2.\f*
\f + \fr 46:4\ft Six. Moses only prescribed two lambs for every day, Numbers 28:9.\f*
\f + \fr 46:5\ft Sacrifice. See Ezechiel 45:24. Flour and oil accompanied the victim. When lambs were presented, this was left to the prince's devotion (ver. 7, 11.; Calmet) only. If he gave three or four ephies of flour, he must give as many hins of oil. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 46:6\ft Calf. Moses orders two, and seven lambs, Numbers 28:11. (Calmet) --- The rams. Hebrew, "a ram. They shall," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 46:9\ft It, perhaps to avoid confusion, (Menochius) and turning the back on the temple, (Calmet) or to exercise their obedience. As many might enter by one gate as by another, and thus the concourse would not be diminished. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 46:10\ft Out. The prince went in and out by the same gate, (ver. 8.) and might order that on the east to be opened when he had to offer a voluntary sacrifice. In other respects he was like a simple Israelite, and was to attend the temple and use the same gates as the rest. Before, the kings had a gate on the west leading to their palace. But this was no longer to subsist, and the palace was to be far removed, Ezechiel 48:21.\f*
\f + \fr 46:11\ft Solemnities. Hebrew, "on feasts and on days of meeting." (Calmet) --- Sacrifice: mincha, ver. 7., and Ezechiel 45:24. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 46:13\ft Morning. That for the evening had the same ceremonies, Leviticus 6:9.\f*
\f + \fr 46:14\ft By. Cata seems to be taken (Calmet) from the Greek kata, "according to," or by, ver. 15. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 46:17\ft Sons. If any portion of his land was made over to them, it still remained in the family; but if any other had a present of it, the land must revert to the royal family, agreeably to the law, Leviticus 25:10. (Calmet) --- This insinuates that works done by the true children of God, in the state of grace, merit an eternal reward, while moral good works performed in the state of sin, can only have a temporal one. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 46:19\ft Gate, on the north, Ezechiel 44:4. --- West. At this corner was the kitchen for victims, which could only be eaten in the inner court. If they had been brought into that without, the people would have become unclean; as it is equally wrong to touch holy or impure things when they are forbidden, Ezechiel 44:19. There were four other kitchens for the people who might choose to eat their peace-offerings, ver. 24. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 46:22\ft Little. Hebrew, "courts joined;" (Protestants) or marginal note, "made with chimneys," (Haydock) or "smoked," as no chimneys were used. Septuagint, "little courts," as they have read differently. (Calmet) --- Vulgate unites both meanings. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 46:24\ft Kitchens. Septuagint, "porticoes," or rather (Calmet) "boiling places;" (Protestants) and ver. 24. (Haydock)\f*

\cd The vision of the holy waters issuing out from under the temple: the borders of the land to be divided among the twelve tribes.
\p
\v 1 And he brought me again to the gate of the house, and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house toward the east: for the forefront, of the house looked toward the east: but the waters came down to the right side of the temple, to the south part of the altar.
\p
\v 2 And he led me out by the way of the north gate, and he caused me to turn to the way without the outward gate, to the way that looked toward the east: and behold there ran out waters on the right side.
\p
\v 3 And when the man that had the line in his hand went out towards the east, he measured a thousand cubits: and he brought me through the water up to the ancles.
\p
\v 4 And again he measured a thousand, and he brought me through the water up to the knees.
\p
\v 5 And he measured a thousand, and he brought me through the water up to the loins. And he measured a thousand, and it was a torrent, which I could not pass over: for the waters were risen so as to make a deep torrent, which could not be passed over.
\p
\v 6 And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man. And he brought me out, and he caused me to turn to the bank of the torrent.
\p
\v 7 And when I had turned myself, behold on the bank of the torrent were very many trees on both sides.
\p
\v 8 And he said to me: These waters that issue forth toward the hillocks of sand to the east, and go down to the plains of the desert, shall go into the sea, and shall go out, and the waters shall be healed.
\p
\v 9 And every living creature that creepeth whithersoever the torrent shall come, shall live: and there shall be fishes in abundance after these waters shall come thither, and they shall be healed, and all things shall live to which the torrent shall come.
\p
\v 10 And the fishers shall stand over these waters, from Engaddi even to Engallim there shall be drying of nets: there shall be many sorts of the fishes thereof, as the fishes of the great sea, a very great multitude:
\p
\v 11 But on the shore thereof, and in the fenny places they shall not be healed, because they shall be turned into salt pits.
\p
\v 12 And by the torrent on the banks thereof, on both sides, shall grow all trees that bear fruit: their leaf shall not fall off, and their fruit shall not fail: every month shall they bring forth first-fruits, because the waters thereof shall issue out of the sanctuary: and the fruits thereof shall be for food, and the leaves thereof for medicine.
\p
\v 13 Thus saith the Lord God: This is the border, by which you shall possess the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: for Joseph hath a double portion.
\p
\v 14 And you shall possess it, every man in like manner as his brother: concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for a possession.
\p
\v 15 And this is the border of the land: toward the north side, from the great sea by the way of Hethalon, as men go to Sedada.
\p
\v 16 Emath, Berotha, Sabarim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Emath, the house of Tichon, which is by the border of Auran.
\p
\v 17 And the border from the sea even to the court of Enon, shall be the border of Damascus, and from the north to the north: the border of Emath, this is the north side.
\p
\v 18 And the east side is from the midst of Auran, and from the midst of Damascus, and from the midst of Galaad, and from the midst of the land of Israel, Jordan making the bound to the east sea, and thus you shall measure the east side.
\p
\v 19 And the south side southward is from Thamar, even to the waters of contradiction of Cades: and the torrent, even to the great sea: and this is the south side southward.
\p
\v 20 And the side toward the sea, is the great sea, from the borders straight on, till thou come to Emath: this is the side of the sea.
\p
\v 21 And you shall divide this land unto you by the tribes of Israel:
\p
\v 22 And you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that shall come over to you, that shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as men of the same country born among the children of Israel: they shall divide the possession with you in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 23 And in what tribe soever the stranger shall be, there shall you give him possession, saith the Lord God.
\f + \fr 47:1\ft Waters. These waters are not to be understood literally, (for there were none such that flowed from the temple) but mystically of the baptism of Christ, and of his doctrine and his grace; the trees that grow on the banks are Christian virtues; the fishes are Christians, that spiritually live in and by these holy waters; the fishermen are the apostles, and apostolic preachers; the fenny places, where there is no health, are such as by being out of the Church are separated from these waters of life. (Challoner) --- It is not probable that real water or fishes were found, ver. 9. But this must be explained of the Church and of baptism, in a higher and more proper sense. (Worthington) --- Joel 3:18. before the captivity, and Zacharias, (xiv. 8.) after that event, speak of fountains as still to appear, and of course not in either temple, though Pilate made aqueducts for the purpose, (Josephus, Jewish Wars 2:13.) which Tacitus, (An. v.) Maundrel, (p. 148.) and others mention. But the prophets allude not to them, but to Christ, the fountain of water springing up unto life eternal, John 4:14., and 7:38. (Calmet) --- Villalpand understands it of waters brought into the temple to wash the victims; but it seems to refer more to the grace and doctrine of Christ. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 47:2\ft East. This gate was shut, and therefore he went out at the north gate. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 47:8\ft The. Hebrew, "the east country," (Protestants; Haydock) or "the frontiers (Gelilah) eastward," by which some improperly suppose that one rivulet went to the sea of Galilee. --- And shall. Hebrew, "the sea of the going out," where the Jordan River empties itself into the Dead Sea; or, the second rivulet ran into the Mediterranean, Zacharias 14:8. But this passage relates to the Dead Sea alone, (ver. 18.) and Gelilah is a place near it, where the Israelites erected an altar of union, Josue 22:10. (Calmet) --- Healed. No fish can live in the sea of Sodom. (Solin xxxviii.) --- Yet, let the place be ever so noxious, this water shall cure it; (see 4 Kings 2:19.; Calmet) which must be taken in a mystical sense. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 47:10\ft Engallim, or "the fountain of Gallim," in the tribe of Benjamin, Isaias 25:44.\f*
\f + \fr 47:11\ft Salt, or bitumen pits. Schismatics and bad Christians, who do not live by the spirit of Christ, are meant. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 47:12\ft First-fruits, or most excellent. (Haydock) --- St. John saw such (Worthington) a tree of life, Apocalypse xxii. (Haydock) --- The doctrine of the gospel, and the study of the sacred books, have the most salutary effects; while the very leaves, or the example of the saints, heal the soul. No more shall the deceitful fruits near Sodom be seen (Calmet) beautiful, but full of nothing but ashes. (Tacitus, An. v.) --- Where Christ instructs, a torrent of grace and glory is presently formed. Like the mustard seed growing into a large tree, in which the birds rest, its origin is mean; yet its progress is grand and astonishing.\f*
\f + \fr 47:13\ft Double portion. Literally, "cord." (Haydock) --- His two sons would each have a share, as Levi was better provided for. (Worthington) --- He had no portion of the land assigned to him by Josue, but here one part is appointed (Calmet) for the sacred ministers and the prince, Ezechiel 45:1.\f*
\f + \fr 47:14\ft Brother. The seven tribes to the north have each an equal share, as the five who lay to the south of the Levites had with respect to each other, though their portion must have been only about half of what the former possessed, according to the map, Ezechiel 45:1. (Haydock) --- Under Josue, the numbers of each tribe were considered. The present mysterious equality shews, perhaps, that there is no distinction of Jew or Gentile in the Church, and that Christ would come to redeem all. (Calmet) --- Lifted. People taking an oath acted in this manner. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 47:15\ft Sedada. These places are not well known. They seem to be near the highest mountain specified, (Numbers 34:7.) west of Emesa.\f*
\f + \fr 47:16\ft Berotha, conquered by David, 2 Kings 8:8.\f*
\f + \fr 47:17\ft Emath was about the middle of the northern limits, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Euphrates River.\f*
\f + \fr 47:18\ft Auran. Hence a line must be drawn through Damascus over Mount Galaad to the eastern or Dead Sea, to form the eastern borders. (Calmet) --- The Jordan River flowing from Genesareth to Sodom marked out this side, (Menochius) or rather was in this division; though the land as far as Galaad was to belong to Israel, as it had been before the captivity. Protestants, "by Jordan from the border unto," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 47:19\ft Thamar. Engaddi is sometimes understood: but it lay near Jericho, as this (Calmet) Thamar was to the south of the Dead Sea. (Ptolemy) --- Torrent Besor. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 47:20\ft Emath, not that it was on the sea: but a line was to be drawn over against this city, eastward from the Mediterranean Sea. Septuagint, "to opposite the entrance of Emath, as far as its entrance." But the territory extended farther, Numbers xxxiv.\f*
\f + \fr 47:22\ft Strangers. This was never done by the Jews. It signifies that Christ would give an inheritance, in the true land of promise [in heaven], (Calmet) to all nations which should practice his religion, Romans 10:12. (Haydock)\f*

\cd The portions of the twelve tribes, of the sanctuary, of the city, and of the prince. The dimensions and gates of the city.
\p
\v 1 And these are the names of the tribes from the borders of the north, by the way of Hethalon, as they go to Emath, the court of Enan, the border of Damascus northward, by the way of Emath. And from the east side thereof, to the sea shall be one portion for Dan.
\p
\v 2 And by the border of Dan, from the east side, even to the side of the sea, one portion for Aser:
\p
\v 3 And by the border of Aser, from the east side, even to the side of the sea, one portion for Nephthali.
\p
\v 4 And by the border of Nephthali, from the east side, even to the side of the sea, one portion for Manasses.
\p
\v 5 And by the border of Manasses, from the east side, even to the side of the sea, one portion for Ephraim.
\p
\v 6 And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side, even to the side of the sea, one portion for Ruben.
\p
\v 7 And by the border of Ruben, from the east side, even to the side of the sea, one portion for Juda.
\p
\v 8 And by the border of Juda, from the east side, even to the side of the sea, shall be the first-fruits which you shall set apart, five and twenty thousand in breadth, and in length, as every one of the portions from the east side, to the side of the sea: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst thereof.
\p
\v 9 The first-fruits which you shall set apart for the Lord: shall be the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand.
\p
\v 10 And these shall be the first-fruits of the sanctuary for the priests: toward the north, five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the sea, ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east, also ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south, five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst thereof.
\p
\v 11 The sanctuary shall be for the priests of the sons of Sadoc, who kept my ceremonies, and went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites also went astray.
\p
\v 12 And for them shall be the first-fruits of the first-fruits of the land holy of holies, by the border of the Levites.
\p
\v 13 And the Levites in like manner shall have by the borders of the priests five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth. All the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
\p
\v 14 And they shall not sell thereof, nor exchange, neither shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated, because they are sanctified to the Lord.
\p
\v 15 But the five thousand that remain in the breadth over-against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.
\p
\v 16 And these are the measures thereof: on the north side four thousand and five hundred: and on the south side four thousand and five hundred: and on the east side four thousand and five hundred: and on the west side four thousand and five hundred.
\p
\v 17 And the suburbs of the city shall be to the north two hundred and fifty, and to the south two hundred and fifty, and to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the sea two hundred and fifty.
\p
\v 18 And the residue in length by the first-fruits of the sanctuary, ten thousand toward the east, and ten thousand toward the west, shall be as the first-fruits of the sanctuary: and the fruits thereof shall be for bread to them that serve the city.
\p
\v 19 And they that serve the city, shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 20 All the first-fruits, of five and twenty thousand, by five and twenty thousand, four-square, shall be set apart for the first-fruits of the sanctuary, and for the possession of the city.
\p
\v 21 And the residue shall be for the prince on every side of the first-fruits of the sanctuary, and of the possession of the city over-against the five and twenty thousand of the first-fruits, unto the east border: toward the sea also, over-against the five and twenty thousand, unto the border of the sea, shall likewise be the portion of the prince: and the first-fruits of the sanctuary, and the sanctuary of the temple, shall be in the midst thereof.
\p
\v 22 And from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, which are in the midst of the prince's portions: what shall be to the border of Juda, and to the border of Benjamin, shall also belong to the prince.
\p
\v 23 And for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side, one portion for Benjamin.
\p
\v 24 And over-against the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side, one portion for Simeon.
\p
\v 25 And by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side, one portion for Issachar.
\p
\v 26 And by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side, one portion for Zabulon.
\p
\v 27 And by the border of Zabulon, from the east side to the side of the sea, one portion for Gad.
\p
\v 28 And by the border of Gad, the south side southward: and the border shall be from Thamar, even to the waters of contradiction of Cades, the inheritance over-against the great sea.
\p
\v 29 This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel: and these are the portions of them, saith the Lord God.
\p
\v 30 And these are the goings out of the city: on the north side thou shalt measure four thousand and five hundred.
\p
\v 31 And the gates of the city according to the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates on the north side, the gate of Ruben one, the gate of Juda one, the gate of Levi one.
\p
\v 32 And at the east side, four thousand and five hundred: and three gates, the gate of Joseph one, the gate of Benjamin one, the gate of Dan one.
\p
\v 33 And at the south side, thou shalt measure four thousand and five hundred: and three gates, the gate of Simeon one, the gate of Issachar one, the gate of Zabulon one.
\p
\v 34 And at the west side, four thousand and five hundred, and their three gates, the gate of Gad one, the gate of Aser one, the gate of Nephthali one.
\p
\v 35 Its circumference was eighteen thousand: and the name of the city from that day, The Lord is there.
\f + \fr 48:1\ft Dan. This division is very different from that of Josue, and was never literally executed, being rather of a mystical nature. The limits are not marked out, as each lot was equal. (Calmet) See Ezechiel 45:1., and 47:14. (Haydock) --- By the twelve tribes all the glorified saints are meant. No cities of refuge occur, because in heaven all are perfect, all secure. (St. Jerome) (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 48:8\ft Apart, for the Levitical tribe and the prince. (Calmet) --- As the first-born and things which spring first, so also the land consecrated to the Lord is called first-fruits. (Worthington) --- Thousand cubits (chap. 45:1.) or 12,500 paces, (Haydock) allowing two cubits for each. This would not reach to the Jordan River. But thrice that space must be reckoned, the king having two of them (Calmet) on each side of the temple, namely, towards the sea, and on the other side of the Jordan. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 48:11\ft Astray, etc. By this we see, that in the worst of times God always preserved some of the priests from going astray; and that the synagogue never fell so universally into idolatry, but that a remnant was still left free from this corruption. (Challoner)\f*
\f + \fr 48:13\ft Ten. Their city was only 18,000 cubits in circumference, ver. 16.\f*
\f + \fr 48:15\ft Profane, where servants of the priests may reside. (Calmet) --- On the north and south, (Haydock) 1000 cubits broad and 25,000 long were left for fields, gardens, etc. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 48:16\ft Five. Hebrew has, "five five hundred:" but one five is properly omitted in several manuscripts and in all the ancient versions. (Kennicott) --- Four thousand five hundred cubits was the length and breadth of the town and temple, which were 18,000 cubits round, (Calmet) or so many reeds, which would make 36 miles of 1000 paces each. As the earthly Jerusalem was certainly never so large, the modern rabbins assert that the Messias will build it to that extent; but Catholic doctors understand it mystically of the Church. Thus St. John saw the New Jerusalem or Church triumphant [in heaven], Apocalypse xxi., and xxii. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 48:17\ft Suburbs, separating the Levites from laics, different from what is mentioned [in] ver. 15.\f*
\f + \fr 48:18\ft As the, etc. They shall not be alienated, as some might infer from its being said to be profane, which term is used because it was the habitation of laymen.\f*
\f + \fr 48:19\ft Israel. People from all parts might serve the Levites. This tribe was not to engage in labourious or sordid employments, being attached to the service of the Lord, and bound to instruct others. But this was more perfectly fulfilled in the Christian Church, where the clergy enjoy great immunities, and are forbidden to exercise any trade or employment which may take them off from their more important spiritual concerns, or render their ministry contemptible. See Exodus 19:6.\f*
\f + \fr 48:20\ft City, where the Levites and their servants, artisans, etc., dwelt. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 48:21\ft Thereof. The domains of the prince touched the limits of Juda on the north, and of Benjamin on the south, as the portion of Levi did also. The prince occupied the east and west square of this division. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 48:28\ft Inheritance. Hebrew nachal, signifies also "torrent;" and St. Jerome seems to prefer this meaning, as he explains it of the torrent which goes by Rhinocorura, and is commonly supposed to be the southern boundary. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 48:30\ft Out, or gates. (Haydock) --- There were three on each of the four sides. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 48:35\ft The Lord is there. This name is here given to the city; that is, the Church of Christ; because the Lord is always with her till the end of the world, Matthew 28:20. (Challoner) --- He always adorns the Church triumphant [in heaven]; (Apocalypse xxii.) but has deserted the synagogue, Matthew 23:38. (Worthington) --- Jerusalem certainly never bore this name, nor is it requisite that she should, if the prophecy had been literally understood. It would suffice, if she could justly claim such a prerogative. See Isaias 7:14., and 2 Kings 12:25. The Church of Christ possesses God for ever. (Calmet)\f*
