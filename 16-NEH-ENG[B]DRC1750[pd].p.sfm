\imt1 THE BOOK OF NEHEMIAS;
\imt5 commonly called the
\imt3 SECOND BOOK OF ESDRAS.
\im This Book takes its name from the writer, who was cup-bearer to Artaxerxes, (surnamed Longimanus) king of Persia, and was sent by him with a commission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. It is also called the Second Book of Esdras, because it is a continuation of the history begun by Esdras, of the state of the people of God after their return from captivity. (Challoner) --- Genebrard believes that the latter wrote the work. But how long must he thus have lived? and how come the lists to vary so much? (Calmet) --- We may allow that these variations are owing to the mistakes of transcribers, (1 Esdras 2:1.) for the writer of both works was certainly inspired. Esdras lived a long time along with Nehemias; (chap. 12:35.) and he may have left memorials, as well as the latter, from which the present work seems to be compiled. (Haydock) --- Some additions have been made since the days of Nehemias, particularly chap. 12:1-26, or at least (Calmet) the five last of these verses. (Capel.) (Chronicles) --- The passage cited from the commentaries of Nehemias, (2 Machabees 2:13.) is not to be found here; which shews that we have not his entire work, but only an abridgment, in which the author has adopted his words, with some few alterations. The fifth chapter seems to be out of its place, and also the dedication of the walls, chap. 12:27. Nehemias was a person in great favour at the court of Persia; and of high birth, probably of the royal family, (Eusebius; Isidore; Genebrard in Chron.) as most of the ancients believe that all who governed, till the time of the Asmoneans, were of the tribe of Juda. Hence he styles Hanani his brother, (chap. 1:2.) and declines entering into the temple, chap. 6:11. His name never occurs among the priests; and though we read [in] 2 Machabees 1:18-21, jussit sacerdos Nehemias, (Tirinus) the Greek has, "Nehemias ordered the priests;" iereis: (Calmet; Huet; Du Hamel) and the title of priest sometimes is given to laymen at the head of affairs. (Haydock) --- In this character Nehemias appeared, by order of Artaxerxes: and notwithstanding the obstructions of the enemies of Juda, rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, and returned after twelve years to court, making a second visit to his own country, a little before the death of the king, whom he probably survived only one year, dying the year of the world 3580, about thirty years after he had been appointed governor. (Calmet) --- In the two first chapters, we behold his solicitude for the welfare of his country, in the ten following his success, and in the last what abuses he corrected. (Worthington) --- He renewed the covenant with God, (chap. 9.; chap. 10.) sent for the sacred fire, and established a library at Jerusalem, 2 Machabees 1:19.; 2 Machabees 1:34.; 2 Machabees 2:13.

\cd Nehemias, hearing of the miserable state of his countrymen in Judea, lamenteth, fasteth, and prayeth to God for their relief.
\p
\v 1 The *words of Nehemias, the son of Helchias. And it came to pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of Susa,
\p
\v 2 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 And they said to me: They that have remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.
\p
\v 4 And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.
\p
\v 5 And I said: *I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments:
\p
\v 6 Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel, thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father's house have sinned.
\p
\v 7 We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies, and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant, Moses.
\p
\v 8 Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses, thy servant, saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
\p
\v 9 But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there.
\p
\v 10 And these are thy servants, and thy people: whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.
\p
\v 11 I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man. For I was the king's cup-bearer.

\f + \fr 1:1\ft Words, or transactions written by Nehemias. (Menochius) --- Helcias, or Hebrew and Septaugint, "Chelcias." --- Casleu, the third of the civil year, 1 Esdras 10:9. --- Year of Artaxerxes, (Calmet) after he was associated with his father on the throne; (Tirinus) or rather the death of Xerxes. From this period the seventy weeks of Daniel are dated, (Du Hamel) or from the 23rd of Artaxerxes, and the 28th of Xerxes, (Tirinus) as above three years must have been consumed in making preparations for the walls, etc. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] 11:5.) --- The name of Nehemias, "comforter of God," as well as his being sent by a king to build, etc., prefigured Jesus Christ, sent by God to comfort and establish his Church. (Ven. Bede) (Worthington) (Haydock) --- Susa. Hebrew, "in Susa, the palace," where the kings of Persia resided in the months of winter, (Athen. 12:1.) and of spring. (Xenophon) (Cyr. viii.) (Curt. 5:8.) --- Here Darius probably kept his court at other times, Esther 1:2. (Calmet) --- Susa was situated on the river Coaspes, between the provinces of Babylon and Persia. (Du Hamel)\f*
\f + \fr 1:2\ft Hanani, a relation, whom Nehemias brought back, 2 Esdras 7:2. --- Came. Some Latin copies add, "to me," (Lyranus) as if a deputation had been sent; but of this the text is silent. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 1:3\ft Province of Judea, subject to the Persians, as it was afterwards to the Romans; though, at present, they were allowed to have governors of their own nation. (Menochius) --- Reproach, on account of the surrounding enemies. (Haydock) --- Fire, recently; (Menochius. See 1 Esdras 4:12., and 9:9.) or rather by Nabuchodonosor; as the kings of Persia would not suffer the city to be fortified, for fear of a fresh rebellion. (Lyranus) (Tirinus) --- We find that little progress (chap. 3.; chap 4.) (Calmet) had at least been made in the work, though the blame must rather be laid on the enemies of Israel, than on several of the kings of Persia, who seem to have authorized the undertaking, which Cambyses, or Smerdis, had for a time interrupted. They only specify, indeed, that leave was granted to build the temple. But they allowed them to erect houses for themselves, which could not have been done to any purpose, among so many enemies, unless they had been defended by some sort of fortifications. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 1:4\ft Days; about four months, till Nisan. (Calmet)\f*

\cl 2 Esdras 2
\cd Nehemias, with commission from king Artaxerxes, cometh to Jerusalem: and exhorteth the Jews to rebuild the walls.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, the king: that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king: and I was as one languishing away before his face.
\p
\v 2 And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceedingly great fear:
\p
\v 3 And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?
\p
\v 4 Then the king said to me: For what doest thou make request? And I prayed to the God of heaven.
\p
\v 5 And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into Judea, to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.
\p
\v 6 And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time.
\p
\v 7 And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into Judea:
\p
\v 8 And a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, to give me timber, that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into. And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God with me.
\p
\v 9 And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent with me captains of soldiers, and horsemen.
\p
\v 10 And Sanaballat, the Horonite, and Tobias, the servant, the Ammonite, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was come, who sought the prosperity of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 11 And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\p
\v 12 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.
\p
\v 13 And I went out by night, by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon-fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of Jerusalem, which was broken down, and the gates thereof, which were consumed with fire.
\p
\v 14 And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass.
\p
\v 15 And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back, I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.
\p
\v 16 But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.
\p
\v 17 Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.
\p
\v 18 And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in good.
\p
\v 19 But Sanaballat, the Horonite, and Tobias, the servant, the Ammonite, and Gossem, the Arabian, heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel against the king?
\p
\v 20 And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem.
\f + \fr 2:1\ft Year of the World 3550, Year before Christ 454.\f*
\f + \fr 2:1\ft Year. It seems the Persians began the year with Tizri, since both Casleu (the third) and Nisan (the seventh month of the civil year) fall on the twentieth of the king. --- Wine. These kings drunk only that of Syria. (Strabo xv.) --- People of distinction were appointed cup-bearers; and even the children of kings did not esteem the office beneath them. (Herodotus 3:34.) (Athen. 10:6.) (Homer, etc.) (Calmet) --- I was. Protestants, "I had not been before-time sad in his presence." (Haydock) --- Hebrew literally, "I was not evil." Septuagint, "an enemy, or stranger." Arabic, "disagreeable." Syriac, "sorrowful." Septuagint also, "there was not another (ouk en eteros) present," 2 Esdras 5:6. St. Jerome seems not to have read the negation. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:2\ft Is not. Hebrew, "nothing but sorrow of heart;" (Syriac; Calmet; Protestants) or rather, thou art meditating only treason. Septuagint, "This is nothing but wickedness of heart," (Haydock) which often shews itself on the countenance. The king might suspect that he was giving him poison. (Menochius) --- Hence Nehemias feared, (Calmet) dreading such suspicions, (Haydock) and aware lest the company might frustrate his good design, as contrary to the interests of the crown. (Tirinus)\f*
\f + \fr 2:3\ft Live; an usual salutation, Daniel 3:9., and 5:10. So Aelian (var. 1:32.) says, "O king Artaxerxes, mayst thou reign for ever." --- Father, ver. 5. He knew that the Persians shewed great regard to the dead, (Calmet; Tirinus) whose bodies they sometimes cover with wax, and keep in their house, (Cic.[Cicero?] Tusc. i.; Alex. Genial 3:2.) or inter. (Herodotus 1:140.)\f*
\f + \fr 2:4\ft Heaven, a fervent ejaculation, in secret, (Tirinus) to touch the king's heart, (Calmet) and to enable me to speak in a proper manner. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 2:6\ft And, etc. In private the queen might dine with her husband, but not in public, Esther 1:(Calmet) --- Queen; probably Esther, if she were married to this king. (Menochius) --- But this is uncertain. (Haydock) --- Usher thinks it was Damaspia, mentioned by Ctesias. (Calmet) --- Time, when I should return. Some say a year (Tirinus) or two afterwards; but it is generally believed that he begged to be absent twelve years. He then waited on the king eight or ten years, and returned into Judea towards the end of the reign of Artaxerxes, 2 Esdras 13:6. (Calmet) --- He perhaps asked permission to visit Jerusalem for only a short period, at first, but his presence being deemed necessary, he was permitted to continue there as governor full twelve years. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 2:7\ft Over; give me a guard, (Haydock) or accompany me to Jerusalem. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 2:8\ft Forest. Hebrew pordes, "paradise," or garden planted with trees. Pliny ([Natural History?] 5:23.) mentions a "paradise," in Coelosyria. (Grotius) --- But Nehemias might petition to be supplied with cedars from Libanus, (Tirinus) as they had been given for the temple, 1 Esdras 3:7. (Haydock) --- Tower. Hebrew bira, means also "a palace or temple." It may designate the porch of the temple, which was 120 cubits high; (2 Paralipomenon 3:4.; Calmet) though that had been lately repaired by Esdras. (Menochius) --- Others think the doors of the courts are meant, as they were as strong as those of towers. (Vatable) --- They were not yet finished, 2 Esdras 10:9. Many believe that (Calmet) Nehemias speaks of the royal palace, which had been almost contiguous to the temple, (Menochius) where he intended to build one for himself, while he should reside in the city. (Tirinus) --- But this might give umbrage to the king. (Calmet) --- He could not, however, intend his favourite to remain without a suitable palace; and the latter seems to have designed not only to repair that which Solomon had founded, but also to erect another house for the governor. (Haydock) --- Good hand; favour, (Menochius) and powerful aid. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:10\ft Horonite, a native, not (Calmet) a petty king (Grotius) of Horonaim, in the country of Moab, Jeremias 48:3. He must have been very old, if he lived till the temple was built at Garizim: (Josephus and Scaliger) but Petau supposes that there were two of the name. --- Servant; an officer appointed over the Samaritans, as well as Sanaballat. The Persian monarchs styled all their subjects servants or slaves. (Calmet) --- Grieved. Thus unbelievers repine when any one endeavours to propagate the truth, (Haydock) or to establish the Church. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:12\ft Any man, at Jerusalem, (ver. 16.) though he had informed the king, ver. 8. (Haydock) --- No beast; that none might be alarmed.\f*
\f + \fr 2:13\ft Valley of Cedron, on the east, (Calmet) or west, near Calvary. (Menochius) (Tirinus) --- Dragon. Hebrew Tannin, or "great fish," which might be kept there, unless the fountain was famous for the appearance of some dragon, or the water proceeded from the mouth of a brazen one. Septuagint have read thanim, "figs." The fountain of Siloe might have many names. (Calmet) --- Viewed. Septuagint, "I walked upon the wall of Jerusalem, which these men are demolishing or clearing away," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 2:14\ft Aqueduct, or reservoir, made by Ezechias, 2 Paralipomenon 32:30.\f*
\f + \fr 2:15\ft Torrent of Cedron, having gone round the city. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:16\ft Magistrates. Septuagint, "guards." Seganim denotes various officers. (Calmet) --- Work, or to any workmen. (Haydock) --- None were now employed. (Tirinus)\f*
\f + \fr 2:18\ft Hand. God had manifested his goodness and power, at the court of Persia. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 2:19\ft Arabian governor. He afterwards accuses Nehemias, 2 Esdras 6:6. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 2:20\ft Answered. Septuagint, "returned them an account (logon) ....we are his pure servants, and we will build." (Haydock) --- Part, or business, 1 Esdras 4:4. --- Justice, or right to the city. (Calmet) --- You may mind your own affairs. (Tirinus) --- Remembrance. It was esteemed a high honour to be a citizen of Jerusalem, Psalm 86:5.\f*

But the situation of these gates is not ascertained. --- Sanctified it, beginning the work (Calmet) with some religious ceremonies. (Junius) --- It was designed to protect God's temple; and therefore, when finished, they dedicated it (Worthington) with solemnity, as they did all the walls, 2 Esdras 12:27. The like custom is observed on laying the foundation-stone of our temples. (Haydock) Sanctified may also mean, cleared away the rubbish. (Vatable) (Tirinus) --- Hundred. Hebrew Mea. --- Cubits is not in the original, Septuagint or Syriac, (Calmet) though it seems to be understood. The ancient Jerusalem had twelve principal gates, four east, north, and west.

Perhaps the governor of Syria had (Haydock) assisted the Jews, unless Nehemias himself be meant. (Menochius)\f*

(Tirinus) --- Hebrew, "they pushed forward, (repaired, Calmet; or) paved, (Du Dieu) or fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall."

\cd The building is carried on notwithstanding the opposition of their enemies.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry: and being moved exceedingly, he scoffed at the Jews.
\p
\v 2 And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the Samaritans: What are the silly Jews doing? Will the Gentiles let them alone? will they sacrifice and make an end in a day? are they able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt?
\p
\v 3 Tobias also, the Ammonite, who was by him said: Let them build: if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall.
\p
\v 4 Hear thou, our God, for we are despised: turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them to be despised in a land of captivity.
\p
\v 5 Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thy face, because they have mocked thy builders.
\p
\v 6 So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the half thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to work.
\p
\v 7 And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Azotians, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were exceedingly angry.
\p
\v 8 And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes.
\p
\v 9 And we prayed to our God, and set watchmen upon the wall day and night against them.
\p
\v 10 And Juda said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the wall.
\p
\v 11 And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand, till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.
\p
\v 12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by them, came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to us,
\p
\v 13 I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.
\p
\v 14 And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief men and the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: Be not afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your houses.
\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had been told us, that God defeated their counsel. And we returned all of us to the walls, every man to his work.
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind them in all the house of Juda.
\p
\v 17 Of them that built on the wall, and that carried burdens, and that laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he held a sword.
\p
\v 18 For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his reins. And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me.
\p
\v 19 And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another:
\p
\v 20 In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run all thither unto us: our God will fight for us.
\p
\v 21 And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear.
\p
\v 22 At that time, also, I said to the people: Let every one with his servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take our turns, in the night, and by day, to work.
\p
\v 23 Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen, that followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every man stript himself when he was to be washed.

\cl 2 Esdras 5
\cd Nehemias blameth the rich for their oppressing the poor. His exhortation, and bounty to his countrymen.
\p
\v 1 Now *there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives, against their brethren, the Jews.
\p
\v 2 And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters are very many: Yet us take up corn for the price of them, and let us eat and live.
\p
\v 3 And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn because of the famine.
\p
\v 4 And others said: Let us borrow money for the king's tribute, and let us give up our fields and vineyards:
\p
\v 5 And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and our children as their children. Behold we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters; and some of our daughters are bond-women already, neither have we wherewith to redeem them; and our fields and our vineyards other men possess.
\p
\v 6 And I was exceedingly angry, when I heard their cry according to these words.
\p
\v 7 And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the nobles and magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one exact usury of your brethren? And I gathered together a great assembly against them,
\p
\v 8 And I said to them: We, as you know, have redeemed, according to our ability, our brethren, the Jews, that were sold to the Gentiles: and will you then sell your brethren, for us to redeem them? And they held their peace, and found not what to answer.
\p
\v 9 And I said to them: The thing you do is not good: why walk you not in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the reproaches of the Gentiles, our enemies?
\p
\v 10 Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money and corn to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us forgive the debt that is owing to us.
\p
\v 11 Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses: and the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which you were wont to exact of them, give it rather for them.
\p
\v 12 And they said: We will restore, and we will require nothing of them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the priests, and took an oath of them, to do according to what I had said.
\p
\v 13 Moreover, I shook my lap, and said: So may God shake every man that shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out of his labours: thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. And all the multitude said: Amen. And they praised God. And the people did according to what was said.
\p
\v 14 And from the day, in which the king commanded me to be governor in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year, even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes, the king, for twelve years, I and my brethren, did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to the governors.
\p
\v 15 But the former governors that had been before me, were chargeable to the people, and took of them, in bread, and wine, and in money, every day, forty sicles: and their officers also oppressed the people. But I did not so for the fear of God.
\p
\v 16 Moreover, I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no land, and all my servants were gathered together to the work.
\p
\v 17 The Jews also, and the magistrates, to the number of one hundred and fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to us from among the nations that were round about us.
\p
\v 18 And there was prepared for me, day by day, one ox, and six choice rams, besides fowls, and once in ten days I gave store of divers wines, and many other things: yet I did not require my yearly allowance as governor: for the people were very much impoverished.

\cd The enemies seek to terrify Nehemias. He proceedeth and finisheth the wall.
\p
\v 1 And *it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gossem, the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,)
\p
\v 2 Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying: Come, and let us make a league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
\p
\v 3 And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you.
\p
\v 4 And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them after the same manner.
\p
\v 5 And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time, according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand, written in this manner:
\p
\v 6 It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them: for which end
\p
\v 7 Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.
\p
\v 8 And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.
\p
\v 9 For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:
\p
\v 10 And I went into the house of Samaia, the son of Dalaia, the son of Metabeel, privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee.
\p
\v 11 And I said: Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that, being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? I will not go in.
\p
\v 12 And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat, had hired him.
\p
\v 13 For he had taken money, that I, being afraid, should do this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal.
\p
\v 14 Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their works of this kind: and Noadias, the prophet, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
\p
\v 15 But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of God.
\p
\v 17 Moreover, in those days, many letters were sent by the principal men of the Jews to Tobias; and from Tobias there came letters to them.
\p
\v 18 For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Sechenias, the son of Area, and Johanan, his son, had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam, the son of Barachias.

(Haydock) --- When the adversaries of faith find themselves unable to suppress it, they offer peace: so when Protestants began, and where they are still weak, they would have none persecuted for any opinions in religious matters; "but where they are strong they hardly grant toleration to Catholics." (Worthington) --- This has been no where more observable than in these [British] islands, where the spirit of persecution has not yet subsided, though banished from most other countries. See Dr. Milner's 4th let. to a Preb.; Debates in Parl. 1810, etc. (Haydock) --- Villages. Most of the Latin editions, before Sixtus V read, in vitulis in campo uno, (Calmet) "with sacrifices of calves in some one field." (Haydock) --- Perhaps Cephirim, (Tirinus) or copirim, "villages," (Haydock) may be the name of a place in the plain of Ono, (Tirinus) which is styled the valley of craftsmen, (chap. 11:35.; Calmet) in the tribe of Benjamin, near the Jordan.

Those who suppose that Nehemias was a priest, say (Calmet) that he refused to flee, lest he should intimidate the people by his cowardly departure.

(Calmet) --- The whole people wrought almost day and night, and Nehemias encouraged them with all his power. (Tirinus) --- Thus Alexander the Great built the walls of New Alexandria, on the Tanais, 60 stadia, or near 6000 paces (Calmet) long, in less than twenty days; (Tirinus) and Caesar perfected other works, before Alise, etc., with equal expedition. (Bel. Gal. i., and vii.) --- The Romans, at the last siege of Jerusalem, surrounded the city with a wall 5000 paces long, and with thirteen towers, in three days. (Josephus, Jewish Wars 6:13.) (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 6:18\ft Mosollam, one of the builders, 2 Esdras 3:4. (Menochius) --- These two powerful men had consequently acted contrary to the laws of God, and the covenant of Esdras, with respect to marriages. They might fear the resentment of the zealous governor. Dangers from false brethren, (2 Corinthians 11:26.) wars without, and fears within, generally assail the servants of God. (Haydock)\f*

\p
\v 1 Now *after the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and numbered the porters and singing men, and Levites:
\p
\v 2 I commanded Hanani, my brother, and Hananias, ruler of the house of Jerusalem, (for he seemed as a sincere man, and one that feared God above the rest),
\p
\v 3 And I said to them: Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened till the sun be hot. And while they were yet standing by, the gates were shut, and barred: and I set watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one by their courses, and every man over-against his house.
\p
\v 4 And the city was very wide and great, and the people few in the midst thereof, and the houses were not built.
\p

(Menochius) --- But as it was not yet built, the house, being placed alone, more properly signifies the temple.

(Calmet) --- Some think that various catalogues were taken, at Babylon, at the first coming to Jerusalem, (Menochius) and at the dedication of the temple; (Tirinus) and that Nehemias refer to a different one from that of Esdras. (Sa) (Lucas) (Tirinus) --- Others suppose that changes were introduced, as the families were increased or diminished, in the time of Nehemias; (Tirinus) who, therefore, judged it necessary to write a fresh catalogue, but only adjusted the old one to the present circumstances, including probably the names of those who had returned with Esdras, or with himself. (Calmet) --- This seems contrary to the text, a book of, etc., and it would perhaps be as well to allow that the variations arise from transcribers, as all allow that many of the names and numbers are corrupted.

\cl 2 Esdras 8
\cd Esdras readeth the law before the people. Nehemias comforteth them. They celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
\p
\v 1 And *the seventh month came: and the children of Israel were in their cities. And all the people were gathered together as one man, to the street which is before the water-gate, and they spoke to Esdras, the scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.
\p
\v 2 Then Esdras, the priest, brought the law before the multitude of men and women, and all those that could understand, in the first day of the seventh month.
\p
\v 3 And he read it plainly in the street that was before the water-gate, from the morning until mid-day, before the men, and the women, and all those that could understand: and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book.
\p
\v 4 And Esdras, the scribe, stood upon a step of wood, which he had made to speak upon: and there stood by him, Mathathias, and Semeia, and Ania, and Uria, and Helcia, and Maasia, on his right hand: and on the left, Phadaia, Misael, and Melchia, and Hasum, and Hasbadana, Zacharia and Mosollam.
\p
\v 5 And Esdras opened the book before all the people: for he was above all the people: and when he had opened it, all the people stood.
\p
\v 6 And Esdras blessed the Lord, the great God: and all the people answered: Amen, amen: lifting up their hands: and they bowed down, and adored God with their faces to the ground.
\p
\v 7 Now Josue, and Bani, and Serebia, Jamin, Accub, Sephthai, Odia, Maasia, Celita, Azarias, Jozabed, Hanan, Phalaia, the Levites, made silence among the people to hear the law: and the people stood in their place.
\p
\v 8 And they read in the book of the law of God distinctly and plainly to be understood: and they understood when it was read.
\p
\v 9 And Nehemias (he is Athersatha) and Esdras, the priest and scribe, and the Levites, who interpreted to all the people, said: This is a holy day to the Lord, our God: do not mourn, nor weep: for all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
\p
\v 10 And he said to them: Go, eat fat meats, and drink sweet wine, and send portions to them that have not prepared for themselves: because it is the holy day of the Lord, and be not sad: for the joy of the Lord is our strength.
\p
\v 11 And the Levites stilled all the people, saying: Hold your peace, for the day is holy, and be not sorrowful.
\p
\v 12 So all the people went to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth: because they understood the words that he had taught them.
\p
\v 13 And on the second day the chiefs of the families of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, were gathered together to Esdras, the scribe, that he should interpret to them the words of the law.
\p
\v 14 And they found written in the law, that the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in tabernacles, on the feast in the seventh month:
\p
\v 15 And that they should proclaim and publish the word in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: Go forth to the mount, and fetch branches of olive, and branches of beautiful wood, branches of myrtle, and branches of palm, and branches of thick trees, to make tabernacles, as it is written.
\p
\v 16 And the people went forth, and brought. And they made themselves tabernacles every man on the top of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water-gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
\p
\v 17 And all the assembly of them that were returned from the captivity, *made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles: for since the days of Josue, the son of Nun, the children of Israel had not done so, until that day: and there was exceedingly great joy.
\p
\v 18 And he read in the book of the law of God, day by day, from the first day till the last, and they kept the solemnity seven days, and in the eighth day a solemn assembly according to the manner.

Pure Hebrew was still retained in the public liturgy. (Tirinus) --- Thus the Catholic Church retains the use of the language first use in the conversion of the respective people, whether Greek, Latin, etc., while she takes care to explain to the people what is necessary, in their own language. Any change might be attended with more serious inconveniences than benefit.

\cd The people repent with fasting and sack-cloth. The Levites confess God's benefits, and the people's ingratitude: they pray for them, and make a coventant with God.
\p
\v 1 And *in the four and twentieth day of the month, the children of Israel came together with fasting, and with sack-cloth, and earth upon them.
\p
\v 2 And the seed of the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger: and they stood, and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\p
\v 3 And they rose up to stand: and they read in the book of the law of the Lord, their God, four times in the day, and four times they confessed, and adored the Lord, their God.
\p
\v 4 And there stood up upon the step of the Levites, Josue, and Bani, and Cedmihel, Sabania, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and Chanani: and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord, their God.
\p
\v 5 And the Levites, Josue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia, Serebia, Odaia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said: Arise, bless the Lord, your God, from eternity to eternity: and blessed be the high name of thy glory, with all blessing and praise.
\p
\v 6 Thou, thyself, O Lord, alone, thou hast made heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and all the host thereof: the earth, and all things that are in it: the seas, and all that are therein: and thou givest life to all these things, and the host of heaven adoreth thee.
\p
\v 7 Thou, O Lord God, art he who didst choose Abram *and broughtest him forth out of the fire of the Chaldeans, and gavest him the name of Abraham.
\p
\v 8 And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee: and thou madest a covenant with him, to give him the land of the Chanaanite, of the Hethite, and of the Amorrhite, and of the Pherezite, and of the Jebusite, and of the Gergesite, to give it to his seed: and thou hast fulfilled thy words, because thou art just.
\p
\v 9 And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt: and thou didst hear their cry by the Red Sea.
\p
\v 10 And thou shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharao, and upon all his servants, and upon the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them: and thou madest thyself a name, as it is at this day.
\p
\v 11 And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry land: but their persecutors thou threwest into the depth, as a stone into mighty waters.
\p
\v 12 And in a pillar of a cloud thou wast their leader by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, that they might see the way by which they went.
\p
\v 13 Thou camest down, also, to Mount Sinai, and didst speak with them from heaven, and thou gavest them right judgments, and the law of truth, ceremonies, and good precepts.
\p
\v 14 Thou madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and didst prescribe to them commandments, and ceremonies, and the law, by the hand of Moses, thy servant.
\p
\v 15 And thou gavest them bread from heaven in their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst, and thou saidst to them that they should go in, and possess the land, upon which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it them.
\p
\v 16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments.
\p
\v 17 And they would not hear, and they remembered not thy wonders which thou hadst done for them. And they hardened their necks, and set their head to return to their bondage, as it were by contention. But thou, a forgiving God, gracious, and merciful, long-suffering, and full of compassion, didst not forsake them.
\p
\v 18 Yea, when they had made also to themselves a molten calf, and had said: This is thy God, that brought thee out of Egypt: and had committed great blasphemies:
\p
\v 19 Yet thou, in thy many mercies, didst not leave them in the desert: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way, and the pillar of fire by night, to shew them the way by which they should go.
\p
\v 20 And thou gavest them thy good Spirit to teach them, and thy manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou gavest them water for their thirst.
\p
\v 21 Forty years didst thou feed them in the desert, and nothing was wanting to them: their garments did not grow old, and their feet were not worn.
\p
\v 22 And thou gavest them kingdoms, and nations, and didst divide lots for them: and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the land of the king of Hesebon, and the land of Og, king of Basan.

\v 23 And thou didst multiply their children, as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst said to their fathers, that they should go in and possess it.
\p
\v 24 And the children came and possessed the land, and thou didst humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the Chanaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as it pleased them.
\p
\v 25 And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods: cisterns made by others, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees, in abundance: and they eat, and were filled, and became fat, and abounded with delight in thy great goodness.
\p
\v 26 But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee, and threw thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy prophets, who admonished them earnestly to return to thee: and they were guilty of great blasphemies.
\p
\v 27 And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they afflicted them. And, in the time of their tribulation, they cried to thee, and thou heardest from heaven, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save them from the hands of their enemies.
\p
\v 28 But after they had rest, they returned to do evil in thy sight: and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and they had dominion over them. Then they returned, and cried to thee: and thou heardest from heaven, and deliveredst them many times in thy mercies.
\p
\v 29 And thou didst admonish them to return to thy law. But they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them: and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
\p
\v 30 And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and didst testify against them by thy spirit, by the hand of thy prophets: and they heard not, and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the lands.
\p
\v 31 Yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them: because thou art a merciful and gracious God.
\p
\v 32 Now, therefore, our God, great, strong, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and all the people from the days of the king of Assur, until this day.
\p
\v 33 And thou art just in all things that have come upon us: because thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly.
\p
\v 34 Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers, have not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies, which thou hast testified among them.
\p
\v 35 And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their most wicked devices.
\p
\v 36 Behold we, ourselves, this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the good things thereof, and we, ourselves, are servants in it.
\p
\v 37 And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation.
\p
\v 38 And because of all this we, ourselves, make a covenant, and write it, and our princes, our Levites, and our priests, sign it.

\x + \xo 9:7\xt Genesis 11:31.\x*
\f + \fr 9:1\ft Month; Tizri, the day after they had sent away those women, (Calmet) whose company now covered them with confusion. (Haydock) --- They were moved to compunction, by the hearing of the law, read by Esdras. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 9:2\ft Stranger; idolatrous woman. (Haydock) --- True repentance requires the works of mortification, and particularly the removal of all occasions of sin and disorderly pleasures. (Worthington) --- The reformation had been commenced under Esdras, but some had relapsed, 1 Esdras 10:3. (Calmet) --- The true born Israelites would have no society with the sons of infidels. (Tirinus) --- Fathers, that they might not be punished for them, Exodus 20:5. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:3\ft Stand, to hear the law, out of reverence; (Menochius) or the Levites ascended the pulpit to read, four times in the day. (Tirinus) --- After each lecture psalms were sung, (Calmet) to praise God, and to declare the sins of the people, and their sincere repentance. (Haydock) --- On days of mourning, the Jews assembled four times to pray, and thrice on other days, by the institution of Esdras. (Maimonides) See Acts 3:1. --- On their fasts, they refrained from all meat, as well as from work, spending their time in prayer. They began at the first hour, and continued their exercises of devotion till the third, when they recommenced for other three hours. They did the like at the sixth and ninth hours; hearing the law, then prostrating themselves to confess their sins. Afterwards they rose to join with the Levites in praising the Lord. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:4\ft Step, erected by Esdras, 2 Esdras 8:4. --- Josue, etc. These Levites are mentioned again, (ver. 5.) with some variation. Bani is called Bonni; Sebania, is Hasebnia. (Calmet) --- Perhaps some of them might be different, as there seems to be no reason for thus changing their names so soon. There are eight persons in both places. Septuagint have, "Jesus and the sons (Bani) of Kadmiel, Sachania, son of Sarabaia, the sons of Chanani, etc.; (5.) and the Levites, Jesus and Kadmiel said, Arise, etc. (6.) and Esdras said, Thou," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 9:5\ft To eternity. Existing. (Sa) --- Bless him continually. (Menochius) --- Let one generation after another praise his holy name. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 9:6\ft Of heavens. The highest, (Calmet) and most glorious (Haydock) residence of the Eternal. --- Host. Stars (Calmet) and angels, (Menochius) which are like his guards. --- Life, or being. If the Levites had adopted the sentiments of the Persians, that the stars were animated, this does not prove the truth of that opinion, which has nevertheless been maintained by many, Genesis 1:18. (Calmet) --- The expression is used for preserving, (Psalm 40:3.; Menochius) re-establishing, etc., 2 Esdras 4:2. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:7\ft The fire of the Chaldeans. The city of Ur, in Chaldea, the name of which signifies fire. Or out of the fire of the tribulations and temptations, to which he was there exposed. The ancient Rabbins understood this literally, affirming that Abraham was cast into the fire by the idolaters, and brought out by a miracle without any hurt. (Challoner) --- The Chaldeans adored fire, (St. Jerome, q. Heb. in Genesis 11:31.) and the Persians probably imitated them. (Strabo xv.) --- The emperor Heraclius destroyed their Pyreia. (Suidas.) --- St. Jerome translates Ur of the Chaldeans, in all other places. (Amama) --- Septuagint, "the country of," etc. (Calmet) --- It is supposed that the sacred fire preserved in this city, gave name to it, (Ur, "fire,") as Heliopolis was so called, from the particular worship of "the sun." (Haydock) --- Abraham, to imply some mystery, Genesis xvii. (Worthington) --- See Isaias 43:27.\f*
\f + \fr 9:10\ft A name, Glorious, (Menochius) and to be feared by all, Exodus xiv.\f*
\f + \fr 9:14\ft Sabbath. Which it seems had not been observed by them before, (Exodus 16:23.; Calmet) at least not with such exactitude. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 9:15\ft Hand. Promising with an oath, (Genesis 14:22.; Menochius; and 22:16.; Calmet) or displaying thy power. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 9:17\ft Their head. Or appointed a leader instead of Moses, (Numbers 14:4.; Menochius) or an idol, Exodus 32:1. Septuagint, "they gave a beginning, or a chief to return." Syriac, "their heart returned to their crimes." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "and in their rebellion appointed a captain to," etc. They turned their back upon the promised land, and set their faces to return into Egypt. (Haydock) --- Sinners are not deprived of free-will. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 9:18\ft Blasphemies. By attributing the perfections of God to a senseless idol. Protestants follow the Septuagint, "provocations." Neatsoth (Haydock) properly implies words of an insulting nature. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:20\ft Spirit. The conducting angel. (Menochius) --- God enlightened and moved the hearts of the people, by his grace; which he gave in abundance to Moses. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:21\ft Worn. So as to be sore, (Haydock) or without shoes. (Menochius) See Deuteronomy 8:4. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "their feet swelled not."\f*
\f + \fr 9:22\ft Lots. Hebrew, "them (the Chanaanites, or as it is more commonly understood, the Israelites,) into corners." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "by lot they possessed," etc. (Haydock) --- Sehon was king of Hesebon, Numbers 21:26. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:24\ft Land. From which most of their fathers were excluded by death.\f*
\f + \fr 9:25\ft Goodness. Prosperity was their ruin, (Haydock) as Moses had foretold, Deuteronomy 32:15. (Calmet) --- "Empire is easily retained by the same arts by which it was procured: but when idleness takes the place of industry, when lust and pride banish continence and equity, fortune is changed with manners." (Sallust; Grotius)\f*
\f + \fr 9:26\ft Earnestly. Literally, called to witness" (Haydock) themselves, (Josue 24:21.) or heaven and earth, Deuteronomy 4:26., and 30:19. (Calmet) --- Blasphemies. See ver. 18. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 9:27\ft Saviours. Josue, (Calmet) and more particularly the judges, (Menochius) David, etc. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:28\ft Rest from their enemies. (Haydock) --- The interval between their relapses was very short. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:29\ft Shoulder. Slipping from under the burden of the law. (Haydock) --- It seems this and the following verses chiefly regard the ten tribes, which proudly rebelled against Juda, (Calmet) and against the Lord. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 9:30\ft Years, 254; during which time God had not ceased to recall his people to a sense of their duty, but all in vain.\f*
\f + \fr 9:32\ft Labour. Receive it in satisfaction. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "let not all the trouble seem little before thee;" as if it were not enough to appease thy anger, when borne with proper dispositions and faith. (Haydock) --- Assur. Theglathphalassar, who led some of the tribes into captivity, as Salmanasar did the rest. During this period, the whole nation was involved in misery, (Calmet) from which they had not been liberated even when the author wrote, ver. 36. (Haydock) (1 Paralipomenon 5:26.) (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 9:33\ft Truth, fulfilled thy promises. We have broken the covenant.\f*
\f + \fr 9:36\ft In it. Tributary to Persia, 2 Esdras 5:4., and 1 Esdras 7:24., and 9:9. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:37\ft Tribulation. As we cannot enjoy the fruits, being so heavily taxed, and obliged to work in person for the king of a foreign country. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 9:38\ft Because. Or "considering all these things," as chastisements due to our transgressions, we are resolved now to reform our conduct, (Haydock) and to comply more exactly with the covenant, which we will now solemnly renew. A copy was probably deposited in the temple, signed by the princes, (Calmet) in the name of all. (Haydock) --- Malachy (Malachias 1:4.) seems to allude to this covenant. (Calmet)\f*

\f + \fr 10:1\ft Year of the World 3551.\f*
\f + \fr 10:1\ft Athersatha. Hebrew hatirshatha. Protestants, "the tirshatha," cup-bearer, or governor, highly (Haydock) "privileged" and honoured by Artaxerxes. (Worthington) --- Hebrew, "And over those who were sealed, (Calmet; Septuagint; or who sealed the deed. Haydock) Nehemias, the cup-bearer." Esdras, Eliasib, etc., were also princes. (Calmet) --- It is not easy to account for the omission of their names. (Menochius) --- They may be designated by different titles. An aristocracy, mixed with oligarchy, was the present form of government. The advice of the ancients, and of the people, was taken. (Calmet) --- Hachelai, is less properly styled Helchias; (chap. 1:1.) where the Septuagint read Chelchias, or Achalia, (Hebrew chacala) as well as here.\f*
\f + \fr 10:8\ft Priests. All, at least after Nehemias. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 10:14\ft Pharos. Many of these are mentioned as returning from Babylon, 2 Esdras 7:8, 11, etc.\f*
\f + \fr 10:28\ft Lands. Idolaters, (Haydock) namely, the proselytes. (Menochius) --- Daughters. These did not all subscribe in person, but by the hands of the intelligent, and chief men, (ver. 29.) or, (Calmet) as the Septuagint seem to understand, these went through the different ranks of the people, and received their oaths. (Estius) (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 10:29\ft Understand. Hebrew mebin, "the teachers," or Levites, 1 Esdras 8:16. (Menochius) --- Promising. Hebrew, "clave to their brethren;" and they promised with a curse to transgressors, and with an oath to walk, etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 10:30\ft And. In all covenants, the articles which have been chiefly broken, are specified. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 10:31\ft Holy day. The contrary practice is therefore sinful. (Haydock) --- Year. Not cultivating the land, Leviticus 25:4. --- Hand. No debts were to be demanded, Deuteronomy 15:1. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 10:32\ft Third part. About 9d., (Haydock) on account of the poverty of the people. (Calmet) --- They afterwards paid half a sicle, or 1s. 2d., conformably to the law, Exodus 30:13., and Matthew 17:23. (Haydock) --- Before the captivity, the kings of Juda provided sacrifices, (2 Paralipomenon 31:3.) and after, the Persian monarchs supplied what was requisite, in favour of Zorababel and Esdras, 2 Esdras 6:8., and 7:21. But these grants had been recalled, or were not well executed.\f*
\f + \fr 10:34\ft Wood. The Nathinites had performed this office till the captivity. But not their numbers were too small. (Calmet) --- The people therefore brought the wood. The Levites, with the Nathinites, carried it into the temple, and the priests laid it upon the altars; all being regulated by lots. (Lyranus) --- Hence the feast called Xylophoria, was instituted about the month of August, as we may gather from Josephus. The Rabbins say that the priests cut the wood, from March till the 15th of July.\f*
\f + \fr 10:35\ft Every tree, of seven species; the pear, apple, fig, apricot, olive, palm, and vine trees; besides wheat, legumes, etc. (Calmet) --- For three years the fruit was deemed unclean, Leviticus 19:23. (Menochius)\f*

\p
\v 1 And the princes of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: but the rest of the people cast lots, to take one part in ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine parts in the other cities.
\p
\v 2 And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 These, therefore, are the chief men of the province, who dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda. And every one dwelt in his possession, in their cities: Israel, the priests, the Levites, the Nathinites, and the children of the servants of Solomon.
\p
\v 4 And in Jerusalem there dwelt some of the children of Juda, and some of the children of Benjamin: of the children of Juda, Athaias, the son of Aziam, the son of Zacharias, the son of Amarias, the son of Saphatias, the son of Malaleel: of the sons of Phares,
\p
\v 5 Maasia, the son of Baruch, the son of Cholhoza, the son of Hazia, the son of Adaia, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zacharias, the son of the Silonite:

\p
\v 13 And his brethren, the chiefs of the fathers: two hundred forty-two. And Amassai, the son of Azreel, the son of Ahazi, the son of Mosollamoth, the son of Emmer,

\p
\v 15 And of the Levites, Semeia the son of Hasub, the son of Azaricam, the son of Hasabia, the son of Bonni,
\p
\v 16 And Sabathai and Jozabed, who were over all the outward business of the house of God, of the princes of the Levites.
\p
\v 17 And Mathania, the son of Micha, the son of Zebedei, the son of Asaph, was the principal man to praise, and to give glory in prayer, and Becbecia, the second, one of his brethren, and Abda the son of Samua, the son of Galal, the son of Idithum.
\p
\v 18 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred eighty-four.
\p
\v 19 And the porters, Accub, Telmon, and their brethren, who kept the doors: a hundred seventy-two.
\p
\v 20 And the rest of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, were in all the cities of Juda, every man in his possession.
\p
\v 21 And the Nathinites, that dwelt in Ophel, and Siaha, and Gaspha, of the Nathinites.
\p
\v 22 And the overseer of the Levites, in Jerusalem, was Azzi, the son of Bani, the son of Hasabia, the son of Mathania, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, were the singing men in the ministry of the house of God.
\p
\v 23 For the king's commandment was concerning them, and an order among the singing men, day by day.
\p
\v 24 And Phathahia, the son of Mesezebel, of the children of Zara, the son of Juda, was at the hand of the king, in all matters concerning the people,
\p
\v 25 And in the houses through all their countries. Of the children of Juda, some dwelt at Cariatharbe, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Cabseel, and in the villages thereof,

\p
\v 35 And Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
\p

But some were compelled, that the city might regain its ancient splendour, and become the bulwark of the nation.

\cd The priests, and Levites, that came up with Zorobabel. The succession of high priests: the solemnity of the dedication of the wall.
\p
\v 1 Now these are the priests, and the Levites, that went up with Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, and Josue: Saraia, Jeremias, Esdras,
\p
\v 2 Amaria, Melluch, Hattus,
\p
\v 3 Sebenias, Rheum, Merimuth,
\p
\v 4 Addo, Genthon, Abia,
\p
\v 5 Miamin, Madia, Belga,
\p
\v 6 Semeia, and Joiarib, Idaia, Sellum, Amoc, Helcias,
\p
\v 7 Idaia. These were the chief of the priests, and of their brethren, in the days of Josue.
\p
\v 8 And the Levites, Jesua, Bennui, Cedmihel, Sarebia, Juda, Mathanias, they and their brethren were over the hymns:
\p
\v 9 And Becbecia, and Hanni, and their brethren, every one in his office.
\p
\v 10 And Josue begot Joacim, and Joacim begot Eliasib, and Eliasib begot Joiada,
\p
\v 11 And Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jeddoa.
\p
\v 12 And in the days of Joacim, the priests and heads of the families were: Of Saraia, Maraia: of Jeremias, Hanania:
\p
\v 13 Of Esdras, Mosollam: and of Amaria, Johanan:
\p
\v 14 Of Milicho, Jonathan: of Sebenia, Joseph:
\p
\v 15 Of Haram, Edna: of Maraioth, Helci:
\p
\v 16 Of Adaia, Zacharia: of Genthon, Mosollam:

\p
\v 20 Of Sellai, Celai: of Amoc, Heber:
\p
\v 21 Of Helcias, Hasebia: of Idaia, Nathanael.
\p
\v 22 The Levites, the chiefs of the families, in the days of Eliasib, and Joiada, and Johanan, and Jeddoa, were recorded, and the priests, in the reign of Darius, the Persian.
\p
\v 23 The sons of Levi, heads of the families, were written in the book of Chronicles, even unto the days of Jonathan, the son of Eliasib.
\p
\v 24 Now the chief of the Levites were Hasebia, Serebia, and Josue, the son of Cedmihel: and their brethren, by their courses, to praise, and to give thanks according to the commandment of David, the man of God, and to wait equally in order.
\p
\v 25 Mathania, and Becbecia, Obedia, and Mosollam, Telmon, Accub, were keepers of the gates, and of the entrances before the gates.
\p
\v 26 These were in the days of Joacim, the son of Josue, the son of Josedec, and in the days of Nehemias, the governor, and of Esdras, the priest and scribe.
\p
\v 27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, and to keep the dedication, and to rejoice with thanksgiving, and with singing, and with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps.
\p
\v 28 And the sons of the singing men were gathered together out of the plain country about Jerusalem, and out of the villages of Nethuphati,
\p
\v 29 And from the house of Galgal, and from the countries of Geba, and Azmaveth: for the singing men had built themselves villages round about Jerusalem.
\p
\v 30 And the priests, and the Levites, were purified, and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\p
\v 31 And I made the princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I appointed two great choirs to give praise. And they went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dunghill-gate.
\p
\v 32 And after them went Osaias, and half of the princes of Juda,
\p
\v 33 And Azarias, Esdras, and Mosollam, Judas, and Benjamin, and Semeia, and Jeremias.
\p
\v 34 And of the sons of the priests with trumpets, Zacharias, the son of Jonathan, the son of Semeia, the son of Mathania, the son of Michaia, the son of Zechur, the son of Asaph,
\p
\v 35 And his brethren, Semeia, and Azareel, Malalai, Galalai, Maai, Nathanael, and Judas, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God: and Esdras, the scribe, before them at the fountain-gate.
\p
\v 36 And they went up over-against them by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall of the house of David, and to the water-gate eastward:
\p
\v 37 And the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the opposite side, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, and upon the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,
\p
\v 38 And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Emath, and even to the flock-gate: and they stood still in the watch-gate.
\p
\v 39 And the two choirs of them that gave praise, stood still at the house of God, and I, and the half of the magistrates with me.
\p
\v 40 And the priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Miamin, Michea, Elioenai, Zacharia, Hanania, with trumpets,
\p
\v 41 And Maasia, and Semeia, and Eleazar, and Azzi, and Johanan, and Melchia, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sung loud, and Jezraia was their overseer:
\p
\v 42 And they sacrificed, on that day, great sacrifices, and they rejoiced: for God had made them joyful with great joy: their wives, also, and their children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.
\p
\v 43 They appointed, also, in that day, men over the storehouses of the treasure, for the libations, and for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, that the rulers of the city might bring them in by them in honour of thanksgiving, for the priests and Levites: for Juda was joyful in the priests and Levites that assisted.
\p
\v 44 And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance of expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon, his son.
\p
\v 45 For in the days of David and Asaph, from the beginning, there were chief singers appointed, to praise with canticles, and give thanks to God.
\p
\v 46 And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Nehemias, gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters, day by day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites sanctified the sons of Aaron.
\f + \fr 12:1\ft Priests. But not all, as some are omitted. See ver. 7, 22, etc. --- Josue, or Jesus, the high priest. --- Esdras, the famous scribe, who is supposed to have returned to Babylon, and to have been living under Nehemias, who came to Jerusalem 81 years after Zorobabel. If, therefore, Esdras was only 20 years old at the former period, he must have lived above 100 years, (Calmet) which is not improbable. (Lyranus; Tirinus, etc.) --- He returned again with many of his countrymen, by the king's leave. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 12:7\ft Chief. Heads of the 24 great families, 1 Paralipomenon 24:18.\f*
\f + \fr 12:8\ft Hymns. To preside over the bands, 2 Esdras 11:17. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 12:9\ft Office. Hebrew, "in the watches," each in his turn, (Vatable) "daily." (Septuagint) (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 12:10\ft Joacim. These are some of the successors of Josue, (Menochius) who were high priests till the time of Jeddoa, or Jaddus. (Worthington)\f*
\f + \fr 12:11\ft Jonathan, is called Johanan by St. Jerome, (in Daniel) Josephus, etc. --- Jeddoa. The Jaddus, who went to meet Alexander, in his pontifical attire, and was graciously received by him; as the monarch revered in his person the God of the Hebrews, who had formerly appeared to him in this manner, to encourage him to undertake the conquests of Asia. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] 11:8.) --- Some think that the names of Jonathan and Jeddoa, and the ver. 22, 23, and 24, have been inserted since the time of Nehemias; as he must have lived 140 years, to see the conquests of Alexander. (Tirinus; Petau; N. Alex. T. 2 Dis. 7.) --- He could not be less than 20, when he returned in [the year of the world] 3550. Jaddus met Alexander in 3672; consequently, at that time, Nehemias was 142 years old. But if he died at the commencement of the reign of Darius Codomannus 3668, he would still be 138. (Calmet) --- Yet this longevity is by no means incredible, ver. 1., and 2 Esdras 13:28. (Haydock) --- Usher (the year of the world 3602) maintains that Johanan was pontiff under Memnon.\f*
\f + \fr 12:12\ft Saraia had given his name to one of the principal families, at the head of which was Maraia, at this time. The Latin manuscripts, Septuagint, and Syriac style him Amaria.\f*
\f + \fr 12:17\ft Phelti was chief of two families, (Calmet) or perhaps the name of the head of Miamin (Haydock) is lost. (Vatable) --- And, is not in Hebrew, "of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Pittai," (Protestants) (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:19\ft Jodaia. The same name is written Idaia, ver. 6, and 21.\f*
\f + \fr 12:22\ft Persian. Surnamed Codomannus, (Haydock) Condomanus, (Grotius; Calmet) or Natus, under whom Jaddus was born, though he was pontiff under the former. (Usher, the year of the world 3553.)\f*
\f + \fr 12:23\ft Chronicles. Not those which are now extant: but some records which regarded the families of the priests. See 1 Esdras 2:61. --- The son, or grandson of Eliasib. The author refers to others records, ver. 26. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 12:24\ft Order. Hebrew, "ward over-against ward." One company kept guard while another retired. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 12:25\ft Entrances. These are not distinctly mentioned before. See 1 Paralipomenon 26:15, 17., and Ezechiel 40:8. (Calmet) --- Septuagint have only, after order, or him, ver. 25. "When I assembled the door-keepers, (ver. 26,) in the days of Joakeim." (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:26\ft Scribe. Could these records have any greater authority than Nehemias himself? It seems, therefore, that this had been added by a later hand, whose testimony is perfectly authentic and inspired. (Calmet) --- Nehemias might also refer to some records which he, or some other, had drawn up. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:27\ft Wall. Some time before, (Usher; Calmet) or now, when the houses were completed. (Ven. Bede) (Tirinus) --- Places, for greater solemnity. The ancients deemed "the walls and gates sacred things, the property of no man." (Justinian, L. sacra loca.) --- Ovid describes the superstitious rites, with which the Romans laid the foundations of their cities, on some lucky day. Fossa fit ad solidum, fruges jaciuntur in ima, etc. (Fast. iv.)\f*
\f + \fr 12:30\ft Were purified first, that they might purify the rest. (Haydock) --- Priests were obliged to abstain from wine, and from their wives, while they were on duty. See 2 Paralipomenon 29:34., and 35:2., etc. Levites were to wash their garments, Leviticus 8:21. All lepers, etc., required a certain purification, ibid. 5:2. 6.[Leviticus 8:2, 6.?] and Numbers 19:16. Care was taken that no dead body was found on the walls. These were probably sprinkled with water, etc., like the tabernacle, Leviticus 8:11.\f*
\f + \fr 12:31\ft Choirs. This is not expressed in Hebrew and Septuagint, but must be understood. Protestants, "great companies of them that gave thanks. Whereof one went." (Haydock) --- The princes led the way, then the priests sounded the trumpets, (Numbers 10:8.) the Levites sung, and were followed by the people. All were divided into two equal parts, and went round half the city. (Calmet) --- They set out from the dunghill-gate, on the west, and proceeded to the watch-gate, on the east, ver. 38. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 12:35\ft Esdras, mentioned [in] ver. 33, was the chief personage, at the head of this company. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:37\ft And, etc. Protestants, "And the other company of them that gave thanks." --- And upon. Hebrew, "beyond." This company (Haydock) proceeded northward. (Calmet)\f*
\f + \fr 12:38\ft Watch-gate. Syriac and Arabic, "great gate," by which they came down.\f*
\f + \fr 12:42\ft Great. Numerous, or victims of a large size, oxen, etc.\f*
\f + \fr 12:43\ft Thanksgiving. St. Jerome, Septuagint, and Syriac have read in a different manner from the present Hebrew, (Calmet which has, "for the tithes to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, the portions of (or by) the law assigned to the priests, etc. Tora, "law," has been read, toda, "thanksgiving," by St. Jerome; and sarim, "princes," has been substituted for sadim, "fields." (Haydock) --- The Syriac admits the second reading. (Calmet) --- Septuagint omit the first entirely. "For the tithes, and for the collections in them, brought to the princes of the cities, being the portions for the priests," etc. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:44\ft Expiation. Or the legal purifications, (Menochius) when necessary. (Haydock)\f*
\f + \fr 12:45\ft Asaph was master of music in the reign of David. (Menochius)\f*
\f + \fr 12:46\ft Sanctified. That is, they gave them that which by the law was set aside, and sanctified for their use. (Challoner) --- The Levites paid a tithe to the priests, (chap. 10:38., and Numbers 18:26.; Calmet) as the people did to them. (Worthington)\f*

\cd Divers abuses are reformed.
\p
\v 1 And* on that day they read in the book of Moses, in the hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come into the church of God for ever:
\p
\v 2 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them: and our God turned the curse into blessing.
\p
\v 3 And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from Israel.
\p
\v 4 And over this thing was Eliasib, the priest, who was set over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to Tobias.
\p
\v 5 And he made him a great store-room, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the first-fruits of the priests.
\p
\v 6 But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two and thirtieth year* of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king:
\p
\v 7 And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house of God.
\p
\v 8 And it seemed to me exceedingly evil. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.
\p
\v 9 And I commanded, and they cleansed the storehouses: and I brought thither again the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.
\p
\v 10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that ministered, were fled away, every man to his own country.
\p
\v 11 And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places.
\p
\v 12 And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil, into the storehouses.
\p
\v 13 And we set over the storehouses Selemias, the priest, and Sadoc, the scribe, and of the Levites, Phadaia, and next to them Hanan, the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as faithful, and to them were committed the portions of their brethren.
\p
\v 14 Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God, and his ceremonies.
\p
\v 15 In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath-day. And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.
\p
\v 16 Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 17 And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them: What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath-day?
\p
\v 18 Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.
\p
\v 19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath-day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath-day.
\p
\v 20 So the merchants, and they that sold all kind of wares, stayed without Jerusalem once or twice.
\p
\v 21 And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you. And from that time they came no more on the sabbath.
\p
\v 22 I spoke also to the Levites, that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath-day: for this, also, remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
\p
\v 23 In those days, also, I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.
\p
\v 24 And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people.
\p
\v 25 And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:
\p
\v 26 *Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin in this kind of thing? and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel:** and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.
\p
\v 27 And shall we also be disobedient, and do all this great evil, to transgress against our God, and marry strange women?
\p
\v 28 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliasib, the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanaballet, the Horonite, and I drove him from me.
\p
\v 29 Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.
\p
\v 30 So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry:
\p
\v 31 And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the first-fruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.

He obtained leave of Alexander to build the famous temple on Garizim, for his son-in-law. He must have been 150 yeas old when Alexander laid siege to Tyre, the year of the world 3672. Esdras and Nehemias were noted for their great age. Yet some would suppose that there were two of the name of Sanaballet; and Josephus says that the one in question was appointed governor of Samaria by Darius, the last king of the Persians. This opinion is adopted by Usher, the year of the world 3972. (Tirinus, etc.) --- But there is still a difficulty to know whether it be necessary. (Calmet) --- From me. In revenge he set up an opposition altar. (Haydock) --- He had contracted a marriage, which was unlawful for all, and entailed degradation upon priests.\f*

His political and moral virtues must ever assign him an exalted rank among the true Israelites. Like Jesus Christ, he rebuilt Jerusalem, reformed the nation, was the mediator of a new covenant, defended the rights of the priesthood and of all the people. (Calmet)\f*
